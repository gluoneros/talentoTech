AU2LNDRGFOS8J,7310172101,Dog Treat,very good,This product is a very health snack for your pup as it is made of 100% beef liver. My puppy does all of his tricks to get this treat. It is a little pricy but the container is large so it should last a long time as long as you don't overfeed.
A3RRSB7FFM07ZU,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs Love These!,My girls love these. I cut them up smaller and use them for training. Definately able to keep the dogs attention when they know something yummy and tasty is coming their way. The price was right too for the amount. As long as the price remains perfect I plan on having a steady supply of this great product!
AFH6TT0SWN59L,7310172101,Dog Treat,Fast shipment,This is 2.5 oz larger than what you can find in pet stores and less expensive. Shipped day the it was ordered and arrived 2 days later with prime.
ALAA0P3GK1VBR,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs Love It,"I have one dog that is a picky eater. I crumble this liver treat into her food bowl and she loves it. If you have a dog that doesn't eat, try this, you won't be disappointed."
A3EKHSRZKXRIFK,7310172101,Dog Treat,Golden loves them!,"My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats. Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However, they do not have the best smell (definitely not something I would eat). :) Will be purchasing more."
A12MGOJOF9FY8P,7310172101,Dog Treat,Corgi loves it,We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!
A2KJO9EPX17ZXE,7310172101,Dog Treat,Healthy High Quality Dog Treat,"Yes, they are a bit expensive but, they are high quality, and pure nutrition.  Good training treat and not too high in calories.  Highly recommend this!"
A3XT9UO2Z8IKZ,7310172101,Dog Treat,Save the best for training,"I have two German Shepherds. I use these as training treats. I also use them when I brush them, which they don't enjoy so much but know they will get treats. We have tried every treat available. These are the best."
A1FZ2I81RT0AUX,7310172101,Dog Treat,great product & value,"Extremely big bucket of yummy treats for training! This is a great value. The pieces are large, but I cut them up into smaller pieces for regular training purposes."
A3HU1E3N2G9PF0,7310172101,Dog Treat,Best Dog Treats,"These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these. Although freeze-dried liver is pricey, you can cut the chunks into tiny chinks and use while training, rewarding, or just saying, 'I love you, my good dog.'"
A3W35OAAB4XNX9,7310172101,Dog Treat,dogs love them,"all natural,dogs favorite treat. Don't give too many because it will constipate dog. My dogs will do anything for these treats!"
A2Z7T96L8XQKOG,7310172101,Dog Treat,Liv-r licious!,"My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!"
A2G1LRD120SJPC,7310172101,Dog Treat,Excellent Product and Made in U.S.A.,"My three very finicky dogs love this product, and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training.  There is only one ingredient in this: liver, all sourced within the United States, so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs.  I buy this on a regular basis.  It's priced better than any pet supply store I've seen, even the larger chains.  Qualifies for free shipping, which is also nice."
A2QXPFTACXWV1I,7310172101,Dog Treat,Liver treats,My dog is not enthusiastic about food.  She enjoys these treats which are light weight and easy to carry.  Number of treats per day must be limited.
A18UVHCREY2RE2,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs love them!,"My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!"
A2EUY9REPJ0XR4,7310172101,Dog Treat,A favorite!,My dogs have been eating liver treats for years.  We also use the treats for training.  The treats are 50% crude protein so you are getting a high quality treat.  Just make sure your dog has enough water since the treats make  my dogs thirsty.
A2H3SATAEPFUDW,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried, Best Part Of Rudy's Day","I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, ""They are the best part of my day!""  We think so too!  ~ CJ"
A4Z0JCSDTQZ88,7310172101,Dog Treat,Puppy loves these,"My dog loves these treats. He's really picking with his treats so it says a lot that he loves these. I had been buying him bags of the freeze dried treats at petco, etc. and it was costing a fortune, not to mention they were smashed. These are great quality. You get tons!! in the 14 ounce bucket and my little dog is in love."
AF44MU313L704,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great!,Our dog loves this stuff.  Ground up and sprinkled on his dry food he just gobbles it up.  No additives or fillers no carbs. We also use as a treat.  Best price at Amazon and quick delivery.
AYS3F0L3VFP6G,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great training treats!,"Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
AFDTV642ZGJ8S,7310172101,Dog Treat,Best dog treats,"I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!"
A32TR272T1PFE1,7310172101,Dog Treat,Awesome!,"Pros:<br />Dog will do anything for this treat.<br />Doesn't smell as bad as many other treats.<br />Easy to break into smaller pieces.<br />Nothing artificial, easy digestion.<br /><br />Cons:<br />More costly than other dog treats.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product. While more expensive, my dog will do anything for this treat. He has several phobias, including getting in and out of the car, and walking through doorways, but he ignores all of his fears to get to this treat."
A3JDAZ5YVHY15U,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Great Product, Great deal","My dogs love these treats and I was buying them from the vet at double the price!  Great deal, great service!"
AS8WFSJTEPKX0,7310172101,Dog Treat,Liver Treats,My dogs LOVE these treats! Freeze dried easy to throw some in a zip lock bag and take them with you. Wonderful training treats because they're so easy to put in your pocket. Great deal too!
A371B3Z09W4GT5,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great treats for dogs,"This is a great treat for dogs, but do read the label: dogs of certain sizes can only have so many of these per day. I violated this and my dog got an upset stomach, so I am just giving a heads up. The cost is a bit high for these treats, but you get a lot of you buy the largest tub. My dogs go crazy for them too!"
A21N1PT1A908KW,7310172101,Dog Treat,Wonderful treat for great price,My dog loves this all natural treat and the price cannot be beat by any store.
A29JUMRL1US6YP,7310172101,Dog Treat,Like Candy for Your Dog,"Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q"">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love."
A24CFW43ZERCSU,7310172101,Dog Treat,DOG LOVES IT,"My dog, a little maltese, loves this product.  She knows she will get it as a reward for doing her business on the wee wee pads.  Works every time to reinforce her behavior. I also received the product in a timely fashion thanks to Amazon."

AQHATKEPH80P0,7310172101,Dog Treat,My dog loves these,The 21 ounce Pro-Treat Beef Liver Treats are a great value and my dog loves them.  I just need to reach for the tub and she will sit and put up her paw.  I even cut them into tiny pieces sometimes and sprinkle them onto her food.  She gobbles up her food when I do that.  This size will last a while.
A1WKFVJCSW1OW6,7310172101,Dog Treat,Good Stuff,"Received very timely, and packed safely; no burst packaging.  Really glad that these people make large enough buckets of this wonderful treat that it makes it affordable.  Dogs love these little cube treats, and they are always fresh since they are freeze dried."
A38H80FBUIF8I3,7310172101,Dog Treat,Amazing Training Treat!!,I have tried several different kinds of training treats from pet stores and they all either made my English Bulldog puppy sick or lose interest. The liver is working great she absolutely loves them and they keep her attention 100%!
A13LAE0YTXA11B,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great for puppy training,"New puppy loves this, only treat he will pay attention to while walking and training. One note, pieces are quite large so I cut them up into smaller pieces so their recommended daily amount goes further.<br /><br />All the dogs in the dog park can't resist my pocket when I have these treats. Usually surrounded by a crowd of dogs all poking at my pocket."
A13MS1JQG2ADOJ,7310172101,Dog Treat,Best dog treat ever,This is the only dog treat that my terrier will eat. We crumble over his dry food and he LOVES it.
ADXXVGRCGQQUO,7310172101,Dog Treat,5 snouts!,"My Westie loves these things!  She loves anything with liver but this one is the best.  Expensive by weight, but well worth it.  The freeze-drying process concentrates the flavor and nutrition:  Susie gives it 5 snouts!"
AZ40270J4JBZN,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Dogs, Cats, Ferrets all love this","I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like."
A2ZO1AYFVQYG44,7310172101,Dog Treat,my 12 year old maltese has always loved these,"No waste , even if she is having a  day when she goes on a hunger strike  she always room for one or 2 or 3 of these and the extra powder on bottom makes a real treat on food , Never met a pooch that did not go crazy over her treats !"
A2SWO60IW01VPX,7310172101,Dog Treat,My Alaskan Malamute Loves Them!!,"These liver treas are phenomenal. When i received the 14oz. bucket by amazon i began training my 3month old Alaskan malamute. Now that a month has passed by, she now knows: Sit, Stay, Down, Paw, & SPEAK! My bucket is almost empty as it only lasted for about a month but was worth every penny as ive read malamutes are very stubborn quite dogs. I gave some to my 2 poodles where they gobbled it down and were begging for more. These treats are highly recommended, plus the liver cubes can be further broken down into quadrants. A+++ product"

AJD41FBJD9010,7310172101,Dog Treat,dogs LOVE it--  best treat for rewards and training,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"

A1K5FEDJ9WI5KV,7310172101,Dog Treat,Be careful! Dogs LOVE IT!,"When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them. NOT THESE. She went nuts over these and looked forward to them every night. The vet said I should give her liver to build her red blood cells up. It helped buy us a little longer with her I think. Now the other 2 dogs are addicted to them also! It is a HEALTHY treat that they love. They would eat the whole tub in one sitting if I would let them! It has no awful liver smell either!"
A223KNNTFHHIM7,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great product,"These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!"

AFXMWPNS1BLU4,7310172101,Dog Treat,Excellent treats,"I have been feeding my greyhounds these treats for years.  My hounds can be a little finicky, but they love these treats.  They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around."

My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety. This one BY FAR is their favorite, and I like it because its all natural with no preservatives. Some of the pieces are pretty big, but easily broken with your finger nail. If you carry some around in your pocket like I do when I'm working with them, watch out - you will have the neighborhood dogs wanting a treat too.  :) The price here is quite good also. It is definitly worth a try!"

AHFT1TU6FEFQ8,7310172101,Dog Treat,The Very Best For Your Dog,"Altho you can't give too many of these to your dog on any given day (not suggested by the manufacturer), I have never found a treat that my German Shorthair Pointer really loved, until we discovered these. Buzzy just loves them more than anything....even more than the meatballs I through in his food to entice him to chow down (he's very finicky)!!! Get em for your best friend!!!"
AJD41FBJD9010,7310172101,Dog Treat,NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"
A3D0PV8Y6577NN,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Size inconsistent, needs water","My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first."
A1BMOH6U3TG99J,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Great for travel, but too expensive, too much prep","These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!"
A184K5PFSEL337,7310172101,Dog Treat,Two paws up!,"My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied ""Yo momma is fat!"") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!"
A2YYTZDZD7V7MX,7310172101,Dog Treat,A great treat,"My young Havapoo was very unhappy when I put him in his cage at night.<br />After I bought this product for him as a treat before going to bed, he is readily willing to enter his cage, munch a few little pieces of the dried liver and go to sleep quite happy. I can recommend this product to all pet lovers."

A34BRSDS9MJXTZ,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Dogs love them, but pieces aren't sized uniformly and they melt when wet","I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the ""special"" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as ""hypnotic"" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart."

A2EDWI5EGP4V9N,7310172101,Dog Treat,Really good treats for training,"I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats."

A2EMJYWOXVQGIN,7310172101,Dog Treat,Best treats we've tried so far,My 5 month old lab goes nuts over these liver treats.  Our vet recommended these as a healthy treat.  Our pup acts like a cat with catnip over these. A big hit. The price and size are excellent and should last a good while.

At 13, she's getting pretty finicky, and these will gather her full attention.<br />Recommended."
A2EIKJ2XFU6J9T,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great but expensive,"It is a great product. It is very nutritional and our dogs absolutely love them. My only issue is that it is outrageously expensive. It is about four times as expensive as coffee per pound, and coffee is already expensive. Liver is a very cheap meat so why $25 per pound. Our problem is our dogs will do anything to get one of these treats, so were stuck."
AIBHCBMBC8Z66,7310172101,Dog Treat,All Natural and Dogs Love them,"We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver ""dust"" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this ""dust"" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted."
A3TFIDKZC95ZK7,7310172101,Dog Treat,Pro treat indeed!,Bought these based on the review and the type of treat. My Peagle puppy loves these more than cheese!

A263978BIOCRZV,7310172101,Dog Treat,Good all natural treats,My dogs love these treats. The only problems I've encountered with these are the left over powder at the bottom and the sizes are not uniform; many big pieces and many very small pieces (very minor problems). But they are all natural and don't upset my dogs stomachs.

Now we use this as his daily treat, and he loves it! My Vet. told me this is a nearly prefect low fat treat. As a result of using Pro-Treat, we hardly ever have to use a leash while walking Buck. If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices. It ranges from powder to 1 inch square, and every thing in between. I have done lots of research and Amazon is the best place to buy this stuff"
AJ1CE24O54TFM,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great liver treats-extra benefits for white dogs,"These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains."
A27RU85KTI2QJ1,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great dog treats,"These dog treats are great motivators. At first the price seems high, but they last a long time because only a few need to be used in each training session. The piece sizes are not uniform, so I often break larger ones in half. The only downside is a tendency to crumble if you carry them in a pants pocket for too long."
A2PHHYUZMCR40S,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs go nuts for these liver treats,"When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss."

A2EPLEYMTHVVKV,7310172101,Dog Treat,Training Reward-High Protein and Non-greasy,"Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping."

I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!"

All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer."

With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training.

My husband had installed the same one in our old house so when our current faucet was leaking I told him not to fix it and we would buy the same one.  It was easy enough for him to install but he did need my assistance a few times to help hold some things in place. Looks great and works great.

All other size packages of this product are strongly sealed, so that a plastic rib must be torn off to remove the lid. At least some tape could be used around the lid on this size.

A371KZ5U8RQ5PL,7310172101,Dog Treat,Gimborn Liver Bits Treats,"We have been using these treats for a very long time, decades, and find they are accepted by almost any of our pets: dog, cat or ferret. They are their reward for taking their meds nicely. We prefer the largest size tubs for economy and convenience, which are usually not available at the pet stores. Thank you for carrying these."
AFGHXL0I9BYXD,7310172101,Dog Treat,Travis loves them; inconsistent in size.,"I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4"" - 1"" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING."
A2JCG7KT8HRSUJ,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs favorite treat,We have a variety of treats for our two shitzus.  Their favorite are the freeze-dried livers.  Nice big container that always has the dogs running when they hear me opening the lid.  Bought two of these.

A12L1NY994GXSF,7310172101,Dog Treat,Freeze Dried Beef Liver,I have been giving the Stewart's Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Beef Liver to my maltipoo named Elvis Lee for many years now along with his daily meals.  It is all PURE Freeze Dried Beef Liver which provides him with protein since he is a very active boy who likes to go for long walks and play ball!  Elvis Lee is very particular about what he likes and this Freeze Dried Liver is on his list of FAVORITES!!
A3P5V207OED3JS,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs go crazy for this,As another reviewer noted...This is like crack for dogs! My dog likes jerky but loves freeze dried liver. The tub may be a but much but is the best value.
ASST51ORV4IEK,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great for treats and training,"I purchased the product to use with training my dogs, as treats, and as a supplement to their dry food.  My dogs love them and best of all they are natural - nothing artifical. A good value for those seeking multiple uses from one treat."
A3KIRC8DQF0Y9Q,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Delicious, pure treats",These smell delicious and my dogs love them. The big tub is the most cost-effective package of high-quality treats that I've found. (Those chicken jerky things from China are not high-quality.)

A30M06JH5R1831,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great Treat,"My dogs love this treat. I use it to train them and just for fun. The nice thing about this product is that if you want the pieces to be smaller, it's easy to cut them up without it crumbling apart. Also, it was a great deal."
A1KJH57UFCFUN0,7310172101,Dog Treat,dogs love these!,"My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)"
A25HD3SZ9HFODY,7310172101,Dog Treat,Dogs love'em,"I was introduced to these treats when I took my dogs to the vet, and saw her giving them these treats.<br />The dogs went crazy for them!<br />Not only that, but there is nothing in this but pure liver.  No added salt, etc....<br /><br />Healthy treats that my dogs love.  And the price is right, too!"
ARYMKWDYJM1TG,7310172101,Dog Treat,Delicious for the Dog,"I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again."
A19J97YZF9IR5K,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great for training.,My dog loves these and so do I : ).  No yucky texture or greasy feel such as with hot dog pieces or cheese pieces and no grossness in your pocket or treat bag.  And my dog will do a lot for a taste of these treats.
A272NYWBBGVAEO,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great treat to use as a high value reward!,"My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!"
A3DLTQQJFTPURF,7310172101,Dog Treat,This it like dog heroin.  There's nothing my dog won't do for liver treats.,"I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats."
A3MU6WPG4R7XIB,7310172101,Dog Treat,Loves liver treats,These Stewarts Liver treats are the love of my wirehaired dachshund's life.

A2CRE3753UMKEK,7310172101,Dog Treat,Doesn't get much better,"I was pet sitting recently and the dog I was sitting for had these in her treat pouch. She loved them so I tried them with my dogs. All 3 dogs were quite well-behaved whenever they saw me reach for these goodies. My son and I jokingly call them ""doggie crack"". They're good for them, they work as training tools, what else can you ask for in a dog treat?"

A58VYTDIZJM77,7310172101,Dog Treat,Woof woof!!,"My three month old Westie loves this treat. The only bad thing is that it's huge for training. If I command sit, it takes him 20 seconds to finish eating it and do the next trick. I recommend breaking it into tiny pieces because the label says 1 or 2 a day only. My pup loves this treat and would do anything for it!"

I have en English Bulldog who is solely motivated by these. I was able to teach her voice commands in a very short time with these liver treats as rewards. While the peices could be a bit smaller (I often cut them up a bit) these are very healthy treats. I love them and my bulldog loves them!"
A2RAHVQXI12VGA,7310172101,Dog Treat,"expensive, but worth it","PRO:<br />-my dogs (maltese and poodle mix) go crazy over these treats. they are very obedient once they know that i'm holding these treats in my hand<br />-since they're freeze dried, i don't have to worry about these treats drying out<br />-although it comes in big cubes, i'm able to cut the cubes into smaller pieces with a plastic knife in order to lengthen the usage out of my stash of these dog treats<br />-my containers always came with very little crumbs/powder at the container's bottom<br /><br />CON:<br />-not uniform sizes<br />-not cheap<br /><br />Conclusion: still a great product, but need some modifications<br />*Since every morsel appears to be so flavorful, all my dogs need is a pinkie nail size amount to reward them.<br />*It may SEEM like the crumbs/powder is useless, but actually, it is still somewhat useful.

AZ7GJ72KEZTB9,7310172101,Dog Treat,Love these... or at least my dog does.,"These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog."
A1WZWIME0UDS0M,7310172101,Dog Treat,"Great treat, but probably not for small dogs","These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites."

A2B0YKE5HE3I9F,7310172101,Dog Treat,Perfect for Small Dogs,"Our two dogs love this product, and we love the fact that it's not loaded with chemical preservatives and fillers.  The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping."

A1VXAORWVJCGJF,7310172101,Dog Treat,Great treat!,"My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for ""mini, spontaneous training sessions"".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them."
ADODIH2V6UBQ9,7310172101,Dog Treat,My dog would do anything for this treat,"By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!"
AFV2584U13XP3,B00004CI84,Movie,A Wacky Entertaining Look At The Afterlife,If this is what the afterlife is going to be like then I guess it won't be so bad when it's my time though gotta stay away from anyone like Beetlejuice.  Tim Burton movies are an a acquired taste while entertaining then do sometimes seem a little out there though that's what makes these movies so entertaining in the first place. The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.  I do advise new comers to try and watch a trailer or clip though as while many especially fans greatly appreciate the movie it might not be for you.
A3TYRRCF18LGNK,B00004CI84,Movie,Funny great movie for kids adults anyone with a sense of humor!,It's Tim Burton's Beetlejuice! It's a great film. Michael Keaton does a wonderful job as beetlejuice and the whole movie is so funny haha blah blah!

A4EB8WZNMNFE,B00004CI84,Movie,A Great Classic,"Beetlejuice is one of those great classic movies from the 80s. It has all the ingredients of a good comedy and Tim Burton to boot. I personally couldn't recommend it more to anyone, especially Tim Burton Fans who for some reason haven't seen this."
A7ICHINJY1Q01,B00004CI84,Movie,boring,"I know this was supposed to be some great funny movie, but I just didn't get it. It started off OK, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were fine, but it just got boring. I couldn't see the point of the movie, even in retrospect. Why make this movie? Plus, the Michael Keaton character was so annoying, I just wanted to go away. I know he was supposed to be annoying, so fine, he did a good job with that, but I don't want to have to listen to it. We watched as a family and my 8-year-old son hated it too. My husband liked it. Maybe it's a guy thing, a grown-up guy thing."
A3IPGCVNG88DSR,B00004CI84,Movie,Just gets better with age!,This is a review for Beetlejuice Blu-Ray.  The video transfer from Warner Bros. is pretty good given the films 25 yr pedigree.  On my disc you must manually select the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless auidio track; it defaults to the Lossy DD 5.1.<br /><br />The Orig. 1.85:1 is slightly stretched to properly fill a 16:9 screen.  Danny Elfman's musical score is showing its age as it is not as crisp as a typical new movie.  Although it is noticebly better than the DVD audio track.<br /><br />It was a must have to fill my ever growing Blu-ray collection!
A2U4X4HOBT90T4,B00004CI84,Movie,BEETLEJUICE..A TIM BURTON CLASSIC!,"[[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]<br /><br />Beetlejuice, the Tim Burton classic from 1988 now comes to you packaged as a 20th Anniversary DVD edition.  Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house.  Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best.  The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's.  But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised!  With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy."
A2H1WNB30JNAWU,B00004CI84,Movie,One of Tim Burton's best movies,Beetlejuice one of Tim Burton's best movies he has done during the 1990's.  I enjoy this movie loads and watch it time and time again.  I never get tired of the movie no matter how many times I watch the movie Beetlejuice.  The actors did such an amazing job and musical score perfect timing on the exact scenes.  But if you love a good comedy movie and talented actors and a very talented director then pick this movie up and enjoy laugh after laugh time and time again.
AKFEZQG6TX0KC,B00004CI84,Movie,Great Movie,"This is a classic movie. It had been a few years since I had seen this film and the blu-ray version is perfect. It's the best version of this film that I've seen since watching it in the movie theatre all those years ago. Great cast, great music and funny as all get out."
A33M7WZLMRHY0A,B00004CI84,Movie,Its Beetlejuice....,"How can you not love watching BeetleJuice.  Michael Keaton is at his very very best, and Alec Baldwin is fun to watch in a younger slimmed down early days role.  My favorite is actualy Geena Davis...she is an amazing actress that just controls the screen with her natural abilities and little effort involved.  The Movie is GREAT in Blu-ray...as usual!"

AY12DBB0U420B,B00004CI84,Movie,A Really Bizarre Spectacle. Classic Tim Burton.,"For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of ""Beetlejuice"" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, ""Beetlejuice"" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
A1L1ESI4YYYX0A,B00004CI84,Movie,Beetlejuice and My Grandkids,"I bought this video to share with my grandchildren.  After my purchase, I was thrilled to be able to see it on my computer while I waited for delivery.  My grandsons and I watched it first on my computer and again when I received the DVD in the mail.  I remember watching this movie with my children, and, now, seeing it again with my grandchildren was just as enjoyable.  The dinner scene with the Day O song was just as hysterical today as it was 20 years ago!"

So, their 'afterlife' case worker suggests hiring a bio-exorcist, Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton), to do the job.<br /><br />The New Yorker's daughter (played by Winona Ryder) serves as mediator and plays a strong supporting role.<br /><br />These words best describe the direction of Tim Burton:<br />""Know what they say about people that commit suicide?

A35ZK3M8L9JUPX,B00004CI84,Movie,Beetlejuice,"A dead couple attempts to scare a modern family out of there house with the help of a bio-exorcist. This movie makes me laugh every time I see it. This movie has amusing twist on a standard ghost story. This is Tim Burton's hilarious, skeptically humorous comedy about the afterlife of two honeymooners."
ASJ54MITON1NO,B00004CI84,Movie,"1988 Tim Burton film, dvd.","Tim Burton's unique vision, which is almost cartoonish at times, really comes across, in this film. A dark comedy, that accents the humor, rather than the horror. Also noteworthy is, Michael Keaton's character, which is not only annoying to the living, but the dead as well. Winona Ryder's character is also interesting to watch."
A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B00004CI84,Movie,"Fun Then, Fun Now; Blu-Ray An Upgrade","This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.  It now IS available on Bllu-Ray and it looks better; nothing outstanding, but a definite improvement in shapnress.<br /><br />Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character ""Beetlejuice""- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br /><br />It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who many times has  played nice people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a ""haunted house"" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br /><br />Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br /><br />Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!"

It's to be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The casting for this film is perfect, Michael Keaton is the outrageously funny and whacky witted (Betelguese - the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist) with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis playing (Adam and Barbara Maitland), a young couple that die prematurely. Adding to the cast are Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara (as Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter Winona Ryder (as Lydia).<br /><br />One of the most hilarious scenes is the dinner party accompanied by Harry Belafonte's Banana Boat song `Day-O'.

Yep soon, they find they are the recently deceased.

A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00004CI84,Movie,Tim Burton's imagination goes wild!,"I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd."

I highly recommend this film, which is often tagged as a ''Halloween movie,'' but can really be enjoyed at ANY time of the year."

A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00004CI84,Movie,Macabre Fun For the Whole Family,"""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" was director Tim Burton's first film but ""Beetlejuice"" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success."

A4RUN01NO4827,B00004CI84,Movie,burton's best?,"Tim Burton's fantastic vision of life after death.Michael Keaton plays one of the best characters in film to the hilt and should have not been forgotten.Winona Ryder plays the goth-type daughter of Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones all who are great in their roles.The story though is based upon a couple,played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis,who drown in a car accident and struggle with the after life and the new owners of their beloved home.The movie is dark,especially when Baldwin and Davis have to go to the head of the dead to find out how to get rid of the new owners.It's interesting how those that have died tragically have to spend the after life working.Harry Belafontes music is put to good use in 2 big scenes.Definitely one of Burton's best works that should not be missed."

A157XTSMJH9XA4,B00004CI84,Movie,Another Twisted Masterpiece From Burton,"Here's the plot of 1988's ""Beetlejuice"", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own)."
A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B00004CI84,Movie,One of Tim Burton's earliest and best films,"Edited this review on 10/28/08.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Beetlejuice as a kid I have found more and more to like about it with each viewing. Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do."
A1NVW4NUXPOSJB,B00004CI84,Movie,A very good fun.,"I loved it. Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh."
A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00004CI84,Movie,Wacky and original,"Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed. It wasn't the best reviewed movie when it came out but that's because critics most likely didn't know what to think about it.<p>  It has fun effects, a wacky and energetic performance by Michael Keaton and an original plot. After all these years there's still nothing quite like Beetle Juice. I mean what other movie has giant sand worms that eat dead people ?"

He's one of the few who agree to stay in the system and direct personal movies for the majors.<p>And his personal world is something very special. Things have a soul or, at least, come to life under Burton's camera. <p>Beetlejuice is one of the first efforts of Tim Burton and it's already great. There's a style, a signature, a world , details which reveal an authentic creator.<p>It's possible you will hate this world but you will not have losed two hours, I guarantee you.

AAI57M3OXP5NK,B00004CI84,Movie,Love This Movie!,"This movie is a very odd movie but I love it because it doesn't follow that Hollywood way to make a movie.  This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.  The movie is about a couple who dies and a new family moves into the house and the couple doesn't want them there because the mother wants to redecorate the house.  this movie has an all-star cast Geena Davis, Alec baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey jones, and many others.  This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.  The DVD I think could have been so much better and they could have included deleted scenes and bloopers because you know there has to be some."

It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place.

API663PFYRQCP,B00004CI84,Movie,"Say it once, say it twice, third time's the charm!","When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was ""Beetlejuice"" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's ""Day O."" Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, ""the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist."" The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever."
A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00004CI84,Movie,"Off-color, Irreverent  Hilarity","I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
A1EARN5PUVIF1S,B00004CI84,Movie,Cheesy Reissue,"My one-star refers to this so-called ""20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"" of this hilarious and eye-popping delight from director Tim Burton.<br /><br />Since the inception of the DVD format, I have been waiting for a proper DVD of Beetlejuice with commentary and special features.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that this pathetic disc is NOT what I have been waiting for.<br /><br />Though they supposedly have spruced up the picture, the ONLY special features are three Beetlejuice cartoons and I think some music track or something.<br /><br />NO commentary, NO behind-the-scenes, NO nothing.<br /><br />So -- NO sale.<br /><br />I'm still waiting..."
AZRJH4JFB59VC,B00004CI84,Movie,"Great movie, terrible DVD","I am continually amazed at the shoddy treatment that some movies get in their DVD release.  This DVD is simply a disgrace, especially considering what a great movie this is.  I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.<p>This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<p>My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less."

A1U1GYM2SIA2PY,B00004CI84,Movie,BeetleJuice- DVD,If you like BeetleJuice and the supernatural then buy this movie you won't be let down.  This is a very good movie fun for all ages.  See this movie is what started the cartoon series on cartoonnetwork in the early 1990's BeetleJuice.  Personally I think Micheal Keaton did a fantastic job as playing BeetleJuice I just really like this movie alot it talk's about what the after life is like basically see Barbara and Adam Maitland die and their ghost's in the movie and they meet BeetleJuice and I'm not going to tell you the rest because you have to watch the movie trust me this movie is really good it will make you want to say BeetleJuice three times.
A10L8O1ZMUIMR2,B00004CI84,Movie,Great movie turned bad,"Just to let you know, this movie is one of my personal favorite ghost movies. That said, I feel I need to tell you some details about this terrible DVD. The packaging is fine, nothing great, but it works. The picture and sound quality are good and make it a good cinematic experience. However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched! Personally, I think fullscreen is for idiots who think they're getting the whole picture when they're not. You people put no actual thought into making DVDs, you just slap some crap together and think its fine. No, it's not fine! Clean up your acts!"
A1B2IZU1JLZA6,B00004CI84,Movie,WARNING: CLAMSHELL EDITION IS EDITED TV VERSION,"I, myself always enjoyed this movie, it's very funny and entertaining, so I didn't hesitate to pick up the clamshell edition.  I guess it was a marketing plan to make the movie more for families or something, but they  have eliminated all strong profanity and elements that are usually edited  in the television version.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  If you want the uncut  version, AVOID THE CLAMSHELL EDITION!"
A3CN5P5Q01FAJ5,B00004CI84,Movie,"Five Star Movie, No Star DVD","This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of ""production notes"" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.<br /><br />All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster."
A1JBLIBZJ5VHO2,B00004CI84,Movie,Great Movie Which SCREAMS for a Special Edition DVD,"I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment.<br /><br />This DVD was released in June, 1997, a scant three months after the initial rollout of the DVD format.  As such, the inadequate menus and lack of functionality reflect a company just learning its way around the capabilities of the format.  The early releases have standard menu designs (with the Warner Logo), standard extras (cast & crew, production notes, trailer (sometimes)), and are usually double-sided with a widescreen format on one side and a fullscreen format on the other.  This was all quite adequate for 1997, but....<br /><br />In 2006, Beetlejuice seems to have been forgotten by Warner.  In a time when so many movies have ""Special"", ""Extra Special"", ""Extra-Extra Special Extended"", and ""Ultimate"" editions, this is one movie which has missed the bandwagon.  What's it going to take, Warner?  A bio-exorcist??<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJUICE<br /><br />BEETLEJ....  SPECIAL EDITION, PLEASE!!"
A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B00004CI84,Movie,Will probably never get tired of this movie,"I've watched this movie so many times I know the dinner table dance routine. Somebody linked it on Facebook, and it made me want to watch the movie again so I did--haven't seen it in years, and I'm surprised I still know the routine. Michael Keaton does a great job as the oh-so-disgusting Beetlejuice, and the rest of the cast plays their roles just as well. The film's plot is just plain weird, but they pulled it off. Couple gets into car accident, dies, tries to figure out how to still live in their house while being dead, and a new family moves in. Should they haunt them? Should they be seen? How do both families coexist, especially with the daughter (Winona Ryder) able to see the ghosts who thought they were in the clear? And why is Beetlejuice always there to crash the party? The movie had a quick pace, funny dialogue and plenty of memorable visuals."
A1MWRQCMOLQSBF,B00004CI84,Movie,Nice F#*@ING modle. Honk Honk,You laugh at this movie so hard. Honestly not a movie for kids but this movie kicks so much ass. LOVE THE ART OF TIM B. Michale Keaton is a genus!
ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004CI84,Movie,Really gets those juices flowing...,"Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.  The film very much looks and feels like almost everything that comes out of the Burton factory, yet it is surprisingly fresh in a way.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that it is one of his earlier works and so the colors and graphics are not as crisp, which adds an almost gothic layer to the films feel.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is the mere fact that Michael Keaton gives the best performance in any Burton film; ever.<br /><br />The film follows Adam and Barbara as they learn to cope with life after death.  Yes, a horrific car accident leaves Adam and Barbara dead yet confined to their home.  The problem is that their impatient neighbor takes no time in selling their home to an eccentric family that does not meet with their approval.  Determined to remove these people from their home they enlist the help of a `bio-exorcist' to do the trick, but they get far more than they bargained for when Beetlejuice comes on the scene.<br /><br />The film has been labeled as `pointless fun' by most of my friends, and to an extent I have to agree.  Many would claim the film is not pointless, for it teaches lessons of acceptance and friendship, and I guess loyalty and respect, but really, are we concerned with any of that?<br /><br />The acting is really good here, and it elevates the film from `pointless' to `pointless fun'.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (complete with those alien eyes she had popping in `The Fly') are absolutely amazing as the dead couple, Adam and Barbara.  Catherine O'Hara is marvelous, award worthy even, as the insanely annoying Delia, and Jeffery Jones knows just how to compliment her as Charles.  Winona Ryder is effectively weird as their daughter Lydia.<br /><br />This film belongs to Keaton though, in what may very well be his finest performance, ever.  There is a fine line to be ridden between hilariously on-point and drastically over-the-top; especially when you are dealing with a typically campy performance.  As Beetlejuice, Keaton finds that line and rides it well, delivering an all over the place comedic performance that never feels `too much', even though it probably is.  He understands how to make his characters insanity justifiably funny and makes him an iconic character.  Everyone knows who Beetlejuice is, even if you haven't seen the movie.<br /><br />In the end I can recommend this movie because it does the trick.  It's sweet and charming in that Tim Burton style, complete with edge and creeps and hilarious thrills.  It looks better than his new stuff because it still has a level of grit, and while it is not as good as `Edward Scissorhands' (his best movie, ever) it is definitely a film that every fan needs to see."
AER15RIMV8E6D,B00004CI84,Movie,A Gothic Tim Burton Classic!!!,"I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!"
A1WP28Z1HFLX4W,B00004CI84,Movie,Clarification,Just wanted to post a correction to what the previous review said...<br /><br />The film is NOT based on the cartoon it's the other way around. The cartoon came later.
A1K94LXX833JTT,B00004CI84,Movie,"Heads off, I mean up, Beetlejuice fans!  New DVDs due out in September, details here","Beetlejuice is coming back to DVD in a newly remastered 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, in both standard definition and Blu-ray, on September 16th, 2008.  The extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (""Skeletons in the Closet,"" ""Spooky Boo-tique,"" ""A-Ha!""), and for the Blu-ray version an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but don't count on it.  The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the specs for the sound haven't been announced.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song"" (""Day-O""), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />If you don't have the old, not-so-great DVD, the new release might be worth waiting for.  Amazon has a page to pre-order the new standard DVD <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AGXEAG"">here</a>.

A3I2J3XODSJXOI,B00004CI84,Movie,best movie ever,well one of the best you just have to have a copy of this.
A2JTZI7Y58X9W5,B00004CI84,Movie,Beetlejuice - Tim Burton's Masterpiece,"When the world didn't know who Tim Burton was, it must have been quite a shock to realise his genius first. This larger than life, colorful, yet dark, very funny, bizarre tale broke into the cinemas, and changed the face of storytelling as we knew it forever. Tim Burton was born, and a whole new dimension of dreams, imagination broke free. Movie was never the same again. And thank Tim Burton for that! You cannot do anything but enjoy this crazy story about a ghost, about the importance of life and love, friendship, and all this covered in an unbelievable cloak."
A32207GKRIJYDI,B00004CI84,Movie,I can't believe this is Michael Keaton!!!,"Beetlejuice is truly a work of art!<br />A bit funny, a bit creepy...simply a masterpiece with a great soundtrack to go with.<br />Tim Burton truly knows how to take you to another world.<br />Great casting as well...nothing could be better about this DVD movie!"
A20LY8E9NGYA4M,B00004CI84,Movie,TIM BURTON MADE A FUNNY GHOSTS TALE.,"*** 1/2 stars rating for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy."
A3ICHEO78NFE4Y,B00004CI84,Movie,Just plain fun!,"I recently saw the DVD 5.1 version of this film and it is excellent. The picture quality is, excuse the pun, picture perfect. The sound is very good on the surround but not much on dialog separation if any at all. But Alec Baldwin makes up for the rest. I have always told my partner that Alec would be the only guy in the world that i would leave him for.  I know it would never happen but each time i watch this movie my fantasy runs wild just like the movie itself.  This is just pure fun, pure entertainment, no thinking involved, no serious plot, no hardship, non racist, non potical just pure fun.  Get  it,,,,,you won't be disappointed.  If anything get it for Alec,,,,they don't get any hotter than him."
A31RM5QU797HPJ,B00004CI84,Movie,"&quot;I'm the ghost with the most, babe&quot;","Simply put: Beetlejuice is the funniest comedy of its kind since Ghostbusters.<br />  Michael Keaton plays the title character, a fun-loving ghost that likes to do mischief.  Beetlejuice is called by a couple (Davis and Baldwin) to get rid of the people who live in thier house."
A1HWMNSQF14MP8,B00004CI84,Movie,A Afterlife Success,"Many movies, have dealt with the figure of death and the dead, from the Good angel clarence in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; to Brad Pitt's abysmal turn as Death himself in &quot;Meet Joe Black.&quot; However, Tim Burton has presented the world with the most interestng look at the dead with Beetlejuice. In the first moments of the movie, Barbara and Adam Maitland go to town, And die in the oddest possible way. They return to thier house, and find them selves confined to it's premises. Thier leaving sends them to a strange desert world Populated by multi-layered sandworms.  Eventually, they find that they are dead, and must remain in their home for 128 years, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the family of NYC artisans that moves in and remodels the place. After consulting with thier &quot;caseworker&quot; Juno,(Sylvia Sidney at her chain-smoking best) they hire a bio-exorcist,Betelguese (pronouced &quot;BeetleJuice,&quot; hence the title) who agrees to help. Unfortunately for the Maitlands, Beetlejuice is an extremely PO'ed demon who refuses to return to the underworld. The visuals and special effects of this movie are completely stunning, and Micheal Keaton gives a performance that must have been a blast to play. Beetlejuice is a beer swilling,cussing,moral-majority's worst nightmare with superpowers, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is one of Tim Burton's Best works, and something he should be proud of."
A344SMIA5JECGM,B00004CI84,Movie,A modern day fairy tale,"A twist of rumplestiskin captured on film, starring michael keaton and geena davis in their prime.  Tim Burton's masterpiece, rumbles with absurdity, and is wonderfully paced to the point where there is not a dull  moment."
A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00004CI84,Movie,They got more than they expected for out in the country,"When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple."
ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00004CI84,Movie,"Wild, Crazy Fun With Ghosts","Well, we already knew Tim Burton has a delightfully warped sense of humor, didn't we? So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled ""Guidebook for the Recently Deceased."" They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but ""went out on his own."" He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy. It's a very Tim Burton sort of film altogether."
A2KJPG496XHHLB,B00004CI84,Movie,Timely delivery; no complaints,"We've loved Beetle Juice forever, and we still swear that we passed the house on a camping trip outside of Freeport, Maine.  We got a new DVD/ Blue Ray player from the kids for Christmas, so it was a choice I thought we'd all enjoy. I think we'll continue to enjoy it for a long time, and we can't wait for the grandchildren to see it.<br />The copy we received was perfect and we're happy."

A6QPAO2ZF27SD,B00004CI84,Movie,TIM BURTON'S FANTASY WORLD IS ALIVE,"Michael Keaton's portrayal of the ultimate fun-loving ghoolie Beetlejuice is fantastic.  While his portrayal in Burton's BATMAN of the lead character is dark and brooding, Beetlejuice lets loose all inhibitions and the actor plays it to the hilt.  The supporting cast is wonderful and Burton's story and direction superb.  Maybe not for young children under 12, as it does have a decidely dark side and some scary ghoolies, it is great family fare and good fun."

A2RUXYJ515XHQ3,B00004CI84,Movie,never gets old!,We ordered this for our annual movie-a-thon we have in our driveway on Halloween... still as funny as it was way back when.
AGBA7LQIR4BHX,B00004CI84,Movie,"Awesome movie, not very ""deluxe"" dvd","I must agree with the few people who complained that this dvd was lacking in special features and whatnot. However, if you have never seen the movie at all, or enjoyed the movie but do not already have a copy, it's still a good buy. It's a great movie, no matter how it's presented on the dvd, and you do get a few episodes of the cartoon as well. I watched Beetlejuice as a kid, both the movie and the cartoons, so I probably would've bought it even if it was a poorly recorded VHS :) In short, don't expect it to be ""deluxe"", but I definitely recommend buying it (unless you already have a standard version of it).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, if you've never seen it, it's basically a ghost story that is purposely presented in a cheesy manner to be funny. If you're familiar with Tim Burton at all, you'll know he tends to stray from the norm. Don't expect to be scared; that's not what this movie is about. It's basically about a nice couple of ghosts who try to scare away the family who lives in their house, but the family isn't scared; in fact, they invite other people over and try to show off the ghosts - so the ghost couple hires a... rather disgusting guy to help them out, and things pretty much go downhill from there. Definitely and old 80s classic."
A1HSL0XKDVO0XJ,B00004CI84,Movie,Always a laugh!,"This is a crazy movie!  Never seen another like it, or in it's class!!  Really enjoyed it :)  This one is worth owning!  Gotta love the plot of this movie, and the actors!"
A1RSXP7MB772E3,B00004CI84,Movie,Best Tim Burton film. He should just stick to this format.,"In beetlejuice I was entirely sucked into this dream like film. The afterlife was a complete quirk, and if it hadn't been accredited to, I would have known already who had directed it. It felt like Batman in it's tone, in its wet darkness, and then the cubistic art world of the urban. I always feel like I'm drawn into the mind of a deeply rooted ""pure abstract"" painters mind. I love the demensions of his creativity. He takes risks also, something I don't see enough of in his latest works. I always feel like it's halloween after watching this film. In fact it's a sort of tradition to watch this film, along with ""a nightmare before christmas"", around halloween time. Nothing gets me into the mode better. An ecclectic scare, with a foolishness appropriate enough to remind you of the cartoon."
A2QOI90Y1HNTP9,B00004CI84,Movie,it's showtime,"this is micheal keaton's funniest movie ever.he worked with tim burton in the 1st 2 batman movies.tim burton i'll admit is pretty freaky with his movies because they're all the same beetlejuice,batman returns,nightmare before christmas,and now willy wonka which i know will be wierd.but i give this movie 5 stars because its got some pretty good effects for the 80's.i just bought the second volume of the cartoon which is cool but i cant find the other ones"

A21GKWZJL8BVJ7,B00004CI84,Movie,On Being Dead,"This is one of my most favorite movies. I'm ashamed at my self. Because it took me so long to finally get it on DVD. This is truly one of the most funniest movies about being dead.<br />Barbara and Adam, are a young couple who die in an accident. Their house is bought by another couple whom they have nothing in common with.<br /> But when Barbara and Adam start to like the father's daughter Lydia. They start to question wither or not scaring the family off, is really what they want."
A1BZEGSNBB7DVS,B00004CI84,Movie,Tim Burton's Best,"This is Tim Burton's best work, well this and Edward Scissorhands are his best work closely followed by Ed Wood and Big Fish.  This movie is witty, imaginiative and a little gory at times but not too gory.  This movie seems to get funnier the more you watch it.  Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.  I mean, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure was good but this was way better ny far.  I recommend this to any Tim Burton fan, or evwn if your not a big fan of his work, you'll still love this movie."
A3C3BAQDZWH5YE,B00004CI84,Movie,...,"It was on the other night, and, having been a big fan of the cartoon when it was being shown, decided to watch it (I'm also trying to see all the Winona Ryder movies I know.). <p> It's a well known fact i like seeing her [Winona Ryder] dance at the end of a movie (hey, it's funny!), but apart from that, it was just a hilarious film and i liked it very much. The only thing  wrong was that it was too short. Maybe the special efects were a bit &quot;off&quot;, but hey, it's an older movie1"
A34NBH479RB0E,B00004CI84,Movie,FUNNY,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS SO FUNNY, MICHAEL KEATON AS BEETLEJUICE WAS RIGHT ON.  AND ALEC BALDWIN PLAYING A GEEKY HUSBAND IS PRICELESS.  I LOVE THE DA-OO SCENCE.  THE KIDS AND I REALLY ENJOY THIS ONE."
A1ODDK3N8XC7UP,B00004CI84,Movie,Classic,I bought the movie because I remember enjoying it as a kid. it did not disappoint. The story and look of the film holds up well.
AJKJBUF3BUXH0,B00004CI84,Movie,Blu-ray Movie,I think blu-ray movies are great.  Although there are some of the older movies that have been done in blu-ray that haven't really come up to the blu-ray quality that the newer movies have.  But I guess that's life.  This one is pretty good quality.
A1G3SYHKCFNYLJ,B00004CI84,Movie,Great video!,One of Michael Keaton's early and best performances. The scene at the dinner table with Harry Belafonte's classic soundtrack is great. I'm not a fan of ultra lib' Alec baldwin but this is really Michael Keaton's movie.
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y,B00004CI84,Movie,Beetlejuice,"You either Like Tim Burton or you don't,I fall in the latter.BeetleJuice is not a big deal for me despite it's huge following and Burton's Following,While there are funny moments I am not the type to like Alice In Wonderland type films that are ""trippy"".I think the Highlight for Me Is Robert Goulet(Goulet!robert gouleeeeeeeeet!)and Wionna Ryder,I can't stand Baldwin."
A3PJJ7MNJNBXXO,B00004CI84,Movie,Bettlejuice movie,"Fun movie, enjoy watching Michael Keaton, watched this movie for many years and wanted a copy for my home library."
AX5JX1E40EBT8,B00004CI84,Movie,Nice,"I live in Brazil and I could not find the movie ara sell here, I contacted all distributors and could not find the movie on DVD. I decided to look into the amazon and found on Blu-Ray. I was very happy with the purchase and now I can only enjoy."
A1GG1SWT2QTOFD,B00004CI84,Movie,love this movie,i got this cause i love the more. the quality is okay but i guess it would look nicer on a 120hz tv
A3K8TDFH5GOPNE,B00004CI84,Movie,A Classic Commedy Piece,An excellent commedy movie. It's alway good to have a piece of good commedy in your movie collection.
A3FGGGA3ADZ2Z9,B00004CI84,Movie,Forgot how funny this was.,"Being a child of the 70""s / 80""s I am now collecting movies from that era. I forgot how funny Beetlejuice is. Great movie!"
A3J0V5L5APJ61R,B00004CI84,Movie,"Day-O, Day-O","My 12 year old had never seen this movie so I bought it for her for Christmas. Needless to say it has been on ever since! Personally, I think this was Michael Keaton's best performance - the Harry Belafonte soundtrack rocks also!"
A17WKJUZPRWGY9,B00004CI84,Movie,Awesome Cheese,"This is one of my favorite movies (and, now that I've purchased it, one of my kids' favorites, too!). This movie is so hilariously cheesy it's irresistable. The soundtrack is great, and the kids always jump up to dance along with the characters at the dinner scene. While some of the lines border on awful, the actors are (usually) believable... and who wouldn't mind watching a young Alec Baldwin (remember? back when he was a hottie?). This movie is a classic and a great addition to any movie library (if for nothing else than historical value)."
ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,B00004CI84,Movie,It's Just So Gross!,"I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, ""Attention K-Mart shoppers!"" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good."
A2WTQL7T70Z1H1,B00004CI84,Movie,fun!,"I have loved this movie since I was a kid!  I loved the characters and the creepy special effects.  the ghosts were funny, but the living humans were even funnier!  it's just a fun movie that you can sit back and enjoy."
A1ZPALFR6ZYKRH,B00004CI84,Movie,Hilarious the the end... of time LOL!,"Bravo Bravo! The atmosphere of this movie is spectacular! It has it's share of gloomy moments and hilarious moments which is what made this movie the success that it was, is, and forever will be."
ASCVAUPIB31OD,B00004CI84,Movie,A Classic One Indeed,"This movie is one of Tim burton's classic movies. A very amusing tale about the after life, About a young couple that died as a result of a car accident. From here on, the couple is getting acquainted with the ghost life style, The good and the bad things (Beetlejuice) , And a psychic sweet girl who is the only one able to see them. A trully great acting performence by all the classic Actors."

GET THEM BOTH! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED! if you like edward sissorhands, the nightmare before christmas, or any of the addams family get this!"
A2DEE7F9XKP3ZR,B00004CI84,Movie,Research - Beatlejuice video - French version,I'm getting crazy.I'm looking for Beatlejuice french version video.<p>Is it really impossible today not to find the French VHS version of this film ?<p>Could U please tell me something about it ? Tks
A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B00004CI84,Movie,Certificate: Puerile,Embarrassing comedy that comes over like a child with 'attention deficit disorder' begging for your approval. Even the film's own internal logic is thrown away towards the end to no extra purpose. The girl floating in the air at the end is rather sweet though.
A2E30DTXCQ807J,B00004CI84,Movie,Light-hearted fantasy diversion,"A haunting movie in which everything is played for laughs.<br /><br />There are no serious moments, deep introspections, revelations, life reviews, insights into life's purpose, etc. It is a non-stop gimmicks, special effects, sight gags, visual fluff suitable for the younger set.<br /><br />The hero and heroine drown together in a car accident, discover they are dead and back in their dearly beloved house. They can't leave because there are monsters outside. Their peace in interrupted by the new owners who decide to redo the place in a ridiculous gaudy style. They notice an unexpected book ""The Handbook for the recently deceased."" on the nightstand which serves as their guide to their new situation. Through it they discover how to reach their ""caseworker"" and an obnoxious haunter named Beetlejuice<br /><br />who might be able to help them remove the new occupants. Everything they try fails to work and in the end they accept the new owners. The owner's daughter becomes closer to them than her step-parents providing the child they always wanted and couldn't have. Other than the idea that they can not see themselves in a mirror and that the new owners cannot see them (except the daugthter), there is little we learn about the afterlife here. We see a couple brief scenes of the caseworker's office which can only be described as depressing. Worst movie I have seen in a long time."
AU0E2I06YSFA4,B00004CI84,Movie,What Amazon ships is not what's pictured.  BEWARE,"Beetlejuice has always been a family favorite.  I was very glad to order this from Amazon.  Unfortunately I thought I was ordering the 20th Anniversary edition shown in the picture with the special cover.  NOPE.....I received just the standard Blu of the movie.  I told Amazon over a month ago and they refuse to fix this ad.  If you just want Beetlejuice...this is for you.  If you are looking for what is shown in the picture, you won't get it.<br /><br />???? What happened to false advertisement ????"
A4GB8I8ACS4PM,B00004CI84,Movie,Great Movie...But NOT Given DELUXE Treatment,"Why oh why do studios stamp ""Deluxe Edition"" on movies and then provide nothing to make it worthy of that title??????  I absolutely LOVE the movie Beetlejuice, and just about anything else Tim Burton has done.  The Blu-ray version of this movie looks and sounds better than any version I've seen before.  The colors are sharp and the sound is greatly improved over other DVD iterations I have seen before.  The movie comes with a nice slipcover featuring the cover art in lenticular motion.  That's about the only really special feature you are going to get on this disc.  With it being the 20th Anniv. of this film, I thought that surely something would have been included about the making of the film, but there is NOTHING.  There is no commentary track, no making of doc., no interviews with the cast.......NOTHING.  Oh you do get 3 episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon.....yaawwwwnn and the original theatrical trailer.  I'm not complaining too much, because I do love this movie, and it is worth the price just to see it in High Definition.  It just ticks me off a little when studios stamp the ""Deluxe Edition"" on the cover, when there is nothing Deluxe about it."
A212YFPHGX0GMK,B00004CI84,Movie,MY FAVORITE MOVIE!,"This has been my favorite movie since I was a little kid. I used to watch it every day! It has perfect casting. This movie has a little of everything-comedy, drama, horror(well sorta).<br /><br />Definitly a must see!<br /><br />~silence~"
A48VQ893Z2KQR,B00004CI84,Movie,5 stars for the movie 2 stars for the dvd,"not much i can say about this movie that fans of the movie dont already know!what i can say is this movie needs better dvd treatment and almost every one can agree with me on that,2disk special edition anyone?!"
A1DU58OZJNPUHV,B00004CI84,Movie,Burton's true debut!,"At the time of its release in 1988, 'Beetlejuice' was a huge hit. Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child."
A1GB1Q193DNFGR,B00004CI84,Movie,Fabulous Comedic Fanasy Directed by a Master,"Beetlejuice is an awe-inspiring wonderfully amusing comedic romp that explores the incredible possibilities of the after-life and the boundaries of the absurd. Telling the tale of a recently dead married couple that suddenly gets led into the chaotic world of the supernatural. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope."
A1JW9NSOVEVPR,B00004CI84,Movie,Why no uncut version,Come on now.  how can you make a 20th anniversary deluxe edition without having the original version.  Not to say it is not a great movie but hey there is no need to edit the movie just so you can show it on disney channel.  I mean no offense but did the producers of this movie say hey why not edit it like a CD so we can sell it at walmart.  Come on where is the love of a good movie.
A2XAKGRUHIE2ZA,B00004CI84,Movie,Blueray:  Great movie.  Blue-Ray-Okay,"I have the DVD, and added the Blue-Ray.  A very good movie.  It is very re-watchable. It's also a good opportunity to view some famous actors in much younger days.  A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.  I thought that was a major selling point in the Blue-Ray movement."
A1CAA94EOP0J2S,B00004CI84,Movie,Great Comedy,"Beetlejuice is the story of ghosts (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who can't get along with the family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder) that moves into their house. The ghosts enlist Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) to help them, and the fun really starts. The movie is directed by Tim Burton. Robert Goulet and Dick Cavett make cameos. The score is by Danny Elfman. This movie has a great cast and a great director. <p>If you're a fan of Burton's other movies, you'll especially like this movie. Like all his movies, it has his distinctive look and feel to it. But anyone can enjoy this far-fetched comedy. Being PG, it should be appropriate for most members of the family. The DVD is lacking some of the special features that I would like to see though - like outtakes, behing-the-scenes, etc..."
A1K94LXX833JTT,B00004CI84,Movie,"Some early details about the new 20th Anniversary Beetlejuice DVD due out on September 16th, 2008","Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song"" (""Day-O""), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />This new release is being marketed as the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.  It will be newly remastered, but the extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (""Skeletons in the Closet,"" ""Spooky Boo-tique,"" ""A-Ha!""), a music-only track, and the trailer.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but usually that doesn't happen.  I've subtracted one star for the poor features in a ""deluxe"" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.  The best thing is likely to be the remastering, which is needed, since the older DVD wasn't all the great.  Looking forward to that."
AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00004CI84,Movie,Tim Burton Goes All Out in His Second Feature Film!,"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
A2SXUINNJD8R25,B00004CI84,Movie,I don't think anyone understands why this movie is enjoyable,"Really, this is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and you know what? I loved it with all my heart. Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love."
A1E5AVR7QJN8HF,B00004CI84,Movie,Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice!!,"This is one of the movies you will neeed to see twice.  Its dark, weird, and very funny.  I remember watching it over over for its has spirts and newish ideas on the dead world with out being scary.  Must see for all.  Not movie is quite like it."
A19JYLHD94K94D,B00004CI84,Movie,Remains one of my favorites,"Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor."
A23QOAXJSWIBS6,B00004CI84,Movie,Underrated showcase of scary-zany Burtonland,"This is definitely a guilty pleasure.  As often as I think I'm not supposed to be liking this film, I can't help it.

This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT.

ADIDQRLLR4KBQ,B00004CI84,Movie,Because My Middle Name is &quot;Weird&quot;,"Set in a small New England town, Tim Burton's masterpiece &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; follows the life of Adam and Barbara Maitlin, owners of a large house and small hardware store. While taking a vacation at home, the couple drowns in a mishap car accident. When their home is taken over by boisterous city-folk, they turn in several directions for help  in haunting the Deets family. One such prospective poltergeist is Beetlejuice- brilliantly played by Michael Keaton. <p>Featuring a star-studded cast including a young Winona Ryder, Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and of course Keaton, the storyline boasts creative, believable characters simply not seen in movies these days. <p>Everything in the storyline is clever, from props to costumes right down the score. One of my absolute favorite films!"
A1ZH086GZYL5MZ,B00004CI84,Movie,"A little gross, a lot of fun","Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in ""Beetlejuice."" His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.<p>Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection."

First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive."

A1K94LXX833JTT,B00004CI84,Movie,"Some early details about the new Blu-ray DVD due out September 16th, 2008","Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song"" (""Day-O""), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />The extras announced are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (""Skeletons in the Closet,"" ""Spooky Boo-tique,"" ""A-Ha!""), a music-only track, the trailer and, according to the press release but not the Warners Brothers web page for this DVD, an exclusive CD soundtrack sampler.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but that would be unusual and I wouldn't count on it.  Five-star movie, three-star extras.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray will be 1080p video, but the complete specs for the sound haven't been announced.  There will be sound and subtitles in several languages, including Spanish.  The old standard DVD isn't all that great in terms of video quality, so the best thing about this new release is likely to be improved image and sound."

A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B00004CI84,Movie,It's Funny To Think The Titular Character Is Only In The Movie Less Than Twenty Minutes,"Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton's best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially ""trapped"" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present ""uniqueness"" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the ""afterlife"" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sort of commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars)."
A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00004CI84,Movie,"""Please, they're dead. It's a little late to be neurotic.""","Oh, snap, that's right, Alec Baldwin once upon a time was svelte, as so documented in BEETLEJUICE, the 1988 film that - along with CLEAN AND SOBER - made a case for Michael Keaton having a streak dark and dangerous enough to qualify him for the then upcoming Batman role.<br /><br />It can be tough when you're newly shuffled off that mortal coil, tough when the shelf life exceeds the expiration date. Adam and Barbara Maitland (Baldwin and Geena Davis) - a young couple in love - are freshly minted ghosts who find themselves confined to their quaint New England home, and they seem content enough with their new sitch. But when a family of obnoxious artsy-fartsy New Yorkers move into their house and threatens to annihilate their peace of mind, the Maitlands may have no recourse but to contract that shady freelance ""bio-exorcist"" Betelgeuse. Certainly, the Handbook for the Recently Deceased isn't much help. Adam and Barbara's irascible case worker Juno - who is supposed to ease them into the afterlife - worsens things by remarking that the Maitlands must spend 125 years on Earth in their house before they can move on. Anyway, it's a delectable twist, this meek and retiring ghostly couple being haunted - and bullied - by the living. BEETLEJUICE, as if you didn't know, is a hugely entertaining supernatural comedy. Harry Belafonte's catchy calypso music simply acts as a bonus.<br /><br />The Maitlands' bridge to the living is Winona Ryder's appealingly strange little goth girl, Lydia Deetz. Lydia is pretty much the only ""house guest"" that Adam and Barbara can tolerate and they, in turn, become surrogate parents to Lydia whose real parents (a shrill Catherine O'Hara, a distracted Jeffrey Jones), let's face it, tend to neglect her to bits. Lydia demonstrates an unnatural awareness of the ghostly Maitlands, and it's her curiosity which helps propel a major plot point - namely, Betelgeuse's getting his hooks into the Maitlands. Adam and Barbara prove to be too mild-mannered and just too nice to put a proper fright into the Deetzes - their idea of scaring the mortals is to possess them and make them dance to Harry Belafonte. Conversely, Betelgeuse embodies equal traits of perversity and meanness and he right away cows the Deetzes; the Deetzes' family friend, Otto, especially has it coming. But then we learn that Betelgeuse has his own nasty end game in mind, with no one but the Maitlands and the spunky little girl, Lydia, to thwart him. As likable as Baldwin and Davis are, Michael Keaton's awesomely manic, joke-a-second performance fuels the movie. He injects just enough demonic chops to come across as a sinister adversary.<br /><br />Director Tim Burton put Hollywood on notice with PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, and BEETLEJUICE only expanded his street creds. BEETLEJUICE exhibits Burton's bag of tricks - the distinctive style, the touch of artistic creativity, that smidge of the surreal and the fantastic. There's a lot of visual treats, ranging from the storybook look of the Maitland home to the bizarre architecture of the offices of the supernatural underworld. The dazzlingly inventive sight gags add to the film's offbeat humor. That waiting room is almost as diverting as the Star Wars cantina in terms of ambiance and their inhabitants. All in all, BEETLEJUICE is an astonishing, demented spin on the classic ghost story. Exorcism has never been more fun... or backwards.<br /><br />So this DVD is The 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition and offers these paltry bonus features:<br /><br />- 3 BEETLEJUICE Cartoon Episodes: ""A-Ha!"", ""Skeletons in the Closet,"" & ""Spooky Boo-tique""<br />- the option to watch the film in Music-Only Track<br />- Theatrical Trailers for BEETLEJUICE and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE"

A1AST89AHN17O7,B00004CI84,Movie,It's show time!,"Of all the movies that Tim Burton did, there are three names that come out a lot during discussions. Of course his two Batmans, then his masterpiece Edward Scissorhands,  but most of all his excellent comedy Beetlejuice. Why's that? Because as a society where we usually consider the after-life as a dark and depressing world, Tim Burton presents death in a different perspective. He represents it as an extremely funny world where people become ghosts stuck in their own houses and are haunted by the living, a world where death is a huge bureaucracy, and a world where there are bio-exorcists, like the one and only Mr. Beetlejuice. Although this is a movie where the main characters are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and they do an excellent job as a recently dead-couple, it's Michael Keaton who deserves the spotlight. For each time he appears on the screen, he just makes you laugh with his funny one-liners (excellent improvisation from Michael Keaton) and his perfect interactions with his co-stars such as Sylvia Sidney, Winona Ryder, Glenn Shaddix, Jeffrey Jones, and Catherine O`Hara, all future collaborators during Tim Burton`s career. Everyone, and I mean everyone, delivers a perfect performance.<br /><br />Not only that it is a movie that has excellent visual effects, both traditional and with the computer. Also, I loved how they were able to integrate gorgeous stop-motion animations during the movie. They were well integrated in the movie and are a proof that this kind of animation can really bring great possibilities to a movie, though there are certain limits to it of course. But hey, that also counts for CGI too.<br /><br />Finally, a great cheer to Danny Elfman, whose soundtrack really gave him the popularity and respect he deserved. A great idea from the makers of this DVD to integrate the soundtrack as a separate audio track.<br /><br />In the end, a great classic that should be listened over and over again and being considered a classic of modern american cinema."
A2IZIYYCEGOMEU,B00004CI84,Movie,THE THREE B'S,"Keaton was amazing in BEETLEJUICE, one of Tim Burton's funniest movies. Alec Baldwin, and Geena Davis do a credible job in their roles as newly departed homeowners caught up in underworld bureaucracy, and Wynona Ryder is delightful as the morbidly-inclined daughter of the 'bio' invaders of the home Baldwin, and Davis don't want to move on from. There are very few dark farces as comically twisted as this delightful romp through the afterlife, and none with a more hilarious lead anywhere. I haven't grown tired of watching this macabre laugh-riot in twenty years, and unless you're missing a funny bone, you won't either."
A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B00004CI84,Movie,The ghost with the most,"After 20 years, this oddball dark comedy hasn't lost its irreverent impact. Up-and-coming director Tim Burton's playfully twisted visual style runs rampant through this movie, saturating nearly every frame. It even turns actor Michael Keaton into sort of a vile living cartoon, the one & only Beetlejuice, a manic bio-exorcist with sinister agendas. The film also boosted the resumes of terrific talents like Jeffrey Jones & Catherine O'Hara (here as an annoying trendy couple transplanted from New York to a small Connecticut town). The film helped maked stars of Geena Davis & Alec Baldwin (as the kind, hapless ghostly couple) and Winona Ryder (as the ex-New Yorker's death-obsessed daughter, Lydia). But this is really Keaton's movie all the way, in spite of a good cast.<br />The art direction, make-up & special effects have Burton's distinctive stamp all over them.<br />I was slightly disappointed that this 20th Anniversary Edition didn't have at least interviews or a making-of featurette (although it includes a handful of the delightful ""Beetlejuice"" animated episodes).<br />However, it's a little offbeat comedy that's achieved cult status over the years (all you have to do is view it to figure out why). Just don't say the title three times!"
AEE48JKI02W5,B00004CI84,Movie,kinda let down,"This is an ok buy. I was really hoping there would have been some interviews with Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, and Geena Davis. Deleted / Extended scenes have to be out there somewhere!  ...but the picture and sound are great!"
A3GJJ634MTAJ06,B00004CI84,Movie,Blu-Ray Review,"I give the blu-ray version of Beetlejuice five stars for the picture and sound quality alone.  The improvements compared to the previous DVD release are HUGE.  If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough."
AFEN54UGJQOK9,B00004CI84,Movie,ONE OF THE BEST GHOST STORIES I KNOW.....,"Here is a movie that is top notch in a lot of ways. It's a great family movie. Some may not agree, but I say it is. Adults will understand it more but kids will love the colorful creatures, even though several aspects of the film will fly right over their heads. Tim Burton really hit the button here on his unique style of filmaking, and really never did it better, even with the number of great films he's waxed his style all over through the years.<br /><br />The story starts with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as ""The Recently Deceased.""  They have to learn how to be ghosts, and it's not easy. That is why there is a department dedicated to helping their cause, however, it is as backed up as an inner city welfare office. This is why sleazy swindlers such as the title character come around, dedicated to taking advantage of their delicate situation.<br /><br />When our ghosts discover that they have to share their small town dream home, with some living artsy-fart aristocrats, it's more then they can bare. SO, as most ghosts would do in this situation, they decide to scare the new tennants away. However, their obvious inexperience proves as a pitfall. Especially since these a*holes get a kick out of it, and start using them as party favors. Enter Michael Keaton as Beedle Geuss (He needs somebody to pronounce his name right).  The couple, desperate, go against the wishes of the department and hire him, to give the new tennants a proper scare. Although they soon realize that they may have gotten in too far over their heads with this ghoul.<br /><br />Lydia, played by Winonna Ryder, is the disillusioned daughter of the artsys and she somehow naturally communicates with the dead, and becomes a friend to the couple. Naturally she becomes the prime target for Beetlejuice also (If I was a sleazy ghoul, I would be all over her too!) and thats when things get ugly. But don't worry too much, because in the end everyone figures out how to compromise, and dance around the house to the tune of Shake Senora. The comedic icing of the whole demented cake.<br /><br />This movie works just as well as a comedy, as it does a terrific ghost story. The effects are great, and a symbol to what made Tim Burton so cool early in his career (who can forget those claymation sand serpents?) The score is perfectly creepy, and this thing is just an all around great movie. Good stuff for the Halloween film fest peeps. I pull it out all the time!"

Beetejuice's character is wodnerfully played -- it's hard to watch him and imagine him as Batman as well because he really gets into this character.  It's kind of a dark, inside-kind-of-joke, movie where you really need to listen to the main character speak because he says so much under his breath, but in-hindsight the second time around, he's much more funny than I remember."

A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N,B00004CI84,Movie,"""I'm the ghost with the most babe""","This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their ""paranormal hosts"" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,""say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!""Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat."
A1XV6E6HR9HSZZ,B00004CI84,Movie,Love it,"I feel in love with this movie when it first came out, years later I am the parent and decided to puchase this movie so my children can enjoy it as well.<br /><br />My son loves this movie, Michael Keton does a wonderful job of portraying the off humor Beetlejuice, Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis does a great job of being the plain Jane/John couple who dies and have not crossed over. Outstanding job to Winona Ryder as Lydia, the misunderstood teen ager who no one appears to understand.<br /><br />I give this movie two thumbs up, one scene in particular that still cracks me up is when they brought back the couple, Alex's character begins to speak and his jaw falls off... not to forget the beloved scene when Beetlejuice is sitting next to the Witch Doctor and steals his number, the head shrinking scene is just too funny for words."
A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00004CI84,Movie,A Tim Burton Classic!,"Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as a very convincing couple with great chemistry), are dead. Now they can't leave their sprawling New England home. Good thing they've got the ""Handbook for the Newly Deceased"" to help guide them on their way through the beuracratic world of the dead.<br /><br />They've got a problem. A new living family (Cahterine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) is inhabiting their house. Worse than that, they're remodeling the place. What's a pair of ghosts to do? When they can't scare them out, they call on the help of the famous Bio-Exorcist: Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton in his best role ever).<br /><br />What results is a mixture of dark comedy and sweet special effects (for the late 80's at least) set in front of stunningly imaginative and interesting scene design.<br /><br />Beetlejuice is a classic, and if you haven't seen it yet, now's your chance. Since this is an old DVD there really aren't many special features. Just a lot of written ""Notes"" on the film, but even those are pretty cool."
A3VMD1TVFCK9KB,B00004CI84,Movie,It's SHOWTIME!!!,"That quote ""And it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it"" will be put to good use, because that is what you'll say when you watch this movie again and again. What is there to say about Tim Burton? He can't stop with the good movies!<br /><br />This has to be up there in at least the top 20 of the best comedies of all time. It's twisted, but very very funny. I swear to you, if you watch this film, you will get one laugh. Probably more if you give it a chance.<br /><br />And of course, Beetlejuice is now one of the most famous charactors in movie history. Way to go, Tim!"
ANEUPVXP9GKJQ,B00004CI84,Movie,old school,"This is an old school DVD. The only extras are ""Read only"" no making of or anything. Still, it is a nice picture that we love about DVDs."
A2KJX73VG7RRCN,B00004CI84,Movie,chew on the dog!,"Classic Tim Burton, Micheal Keaton at his best, and the movie that introduced me to Winona Ryder. I love it.  I wish I knew what the impetus was for this twisted take on the afterlife.  It was hilarious when I was 10 and 17 years later I still thoroughly enjoy it."
A30CE2CDDBVNDE,B00004CI84,Movie,day-o,"I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic."
A3K3YJWV0N54ZO,B00004CI84,Movie,"Beetlejuice is a greatmovie, but they cheated you on the dvd","Just to warn you. when in trying to trick you in the widescreen format, the company made a mistake by also including the full screen version with it.  i compared the widescreen and the full screen. and the full screen seems to comtain more picture at the top and bottom.  which must mean, that all they did was take the full screen version, cut off the top a bottom slightly and call it widescreen.  which is strange because i would expect it to be easier just to make the theatrical version than to carefully edit the full screen and rip many people off."
ACJR7EQF9S6FP,B00004CI84,Movie,Bettlejuice...Bettlejuice...BETTLEJUICE!,"What happens when you say his name three times? Michael Keaten stars in this comedy about two couples that live in an old two story house.  While coming back from a supply store, the couple suddenly get caught inside of a  &quot;broken-up&quot; bridge and then just before they start to tumble down  into the lake, a board catches them.  But just when they've got their hopes  up, and small dog steps on the board and the car starts to slide off the  bridge and into the lake waters.  A few minutes later...<p>They find  themselves back into their home, they find that somehow somehad light the  fireplace, as if done by magic.  From then on, they find a weird-looking  dead guy known as Bettlejuice.  The only way they can get him for help is  to call him by his name three times and he will appear at their survice.  But they soon wish that they have never called his name, because  Bettlejuice was once a troublemaker but he is the only one who can save  them, on the account that they said his name three times.  They can't leave  their houses or else they will find theirselves in another world with giant  sandworms.  This is a stellar comedy that you should see! Michael Keaton is  awesome as he plays the leading role of Bettlejuice."
AZADBDIG2188H,B00004CI84,Movie,Beetlejuice,"Awesome, fun movie! I never tire watching it over and over. Great cast.<br /><br />This film is the one to watch to get in the Halloween mood."
AD8X8DT1F6WMQ,B00004CI84,Movie,Great experience!,The DVD arrived in brand new packaging and I received it timely and when I was told that I would.  Would buy again.
A3ILKXATA65Z17,B00004CI84,Movie,beetlejuice,I truly enjoy this movie and it is a classic. Like watching old movies with stars who are big celebrities now. This was a start with their popularity. The movie is funny and very interesting story
AXLSYCFQEQ3FD,B00004CI84,Movie,Delightfully entertaining!,This is a fun movie and appropriate for older children through adults.  We enjoyed watching it with our 2 children ages 9 and 11.  The music is fun too.
A3KV0NO0TQTW3Y,B00004CI84,Movie,Love this movie!!,I've always loved Beetlejuice and it's no surprise I love this DVD! It's a classic and it even includes a few episodes of the cartoon version. It's AWESOME.
A265Z6W34O96KV,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole Trap,The trap itself seems to be great.  The instructions are not very clear but you can find videos on youtube for help.
AJWF6GWDNOJ04,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It Really Works,I caught a mole the first week that I put this out. It saved me a lot of money by not having to sign another contract with a pest control service.
A1HGVAXMSUJ7AX,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The BEST Mole Trap,"Finally after trying about everything on the market for mole problems in the last 15 years I got lucky and bought this amazing trap. I adjusted and set the trap in the evening after recieving it, next morning I checked the trap and I had caught one of the moles that had been messing up my lawn and garden for about 2 years. I have tried gas, poison,and other traps, always without any known success. The give-away tunnels have always re-appeared. I finally am confident that my problem is over. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RAMY"">Victor 0631 Out O'Sight Mole Trap</a>THANK YOU Victor 0631 and Amazon for quick and dependable delivery as always."
A9Z7AY40CUOMX,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole trap by Victor,I wrote a review before and will say they're great - you'll have to read directions and once you get the hang of it look out moles! I did have to put an empty buckrt with a rock on top so the pets wouldn't get hurt.Thank you.
A2BVVDD3SI1RM8,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole trap,"This item works well if you follow the directions exactly.  If you don't have any patience get something else, but this works.  In fact if you have a big mole problem you might want to get more than one.  I would purchase it again."
A8JP7MZH2S3X3,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Yup it worked!,watched some videos on how to use.<br />set the trap.<br />left it.<br />5 or 6 days later....dead mole that had been destroying my lawn.<br /><br />Thank you Victor!
A183R9LA41I012,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Works Great!!,this is the best product to get rid of moles. i went to home depot and spent a bunch of money trying to get rid of these moles. . .  nothing worked until i purchased this Victor Out O'Sight Mole Trap. the first day i set the trap i didn't have any luck. i left the traps in the same place and woke up with 2 moles caught in my traps (being i had 3 traps). ever since then about 3 months ago i have not had a single mole come into my yard. great product. i have recommended to one of friends and same results!!!!
A120VYRJZ9MXO3,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,This trap is the best style of trap that I have used,I have tried many of the mole traps/preventers on the web. This one REALLY works. I have caught 15 moles this year and my lawn looks so much better and I am not doing a Bill Murray every weekend
A3E0OQIXU6S3CI,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Worked well for me,"I had a tunnel along my concrete driveway and the grass about 10' long and had 5 mole hills.  I set a trap at both ends.  When I dug into the first mole hill to set the trap I noticed a half eaten grub and placed it on the trigger bar, covered with some dirt, and put a pail over the trap to keep it dark.<br />About 2 hours later I checked the trap and it had sprung. I carefully lifted the trap and a mole was caught in the trap but not dead.  Be ready for that.<br />I have not seen any further evidence of moles but if I use this trap again I will try adding a grub or worm bait to attract them."
A1KJM9PS3JJH8P,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,caught none,"Have used the trap for a month carefully following directions. Have tried a new location every few days. Have not caught a single mole. Meanwhile, the yard fills with more and more tunnels. Don't expect success and you won't be disappointed."
A1YXINTMWBAPVX,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"dangerous, doesn't work","very hard to set, you could loose fingers if your not careful. triggering mechanism is hard to set and make it stay and takes way too much pressure to spring the trap. placed as instructed, moles just tunnel around it.you have to disturb the ground too much to be able to set it. was excited about getting them, but very disappointed in results.have not caught a single mole and they continue to make swiss cheese out of my yard."
A1LL9450OSSND1,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Scissor mole trap... the only way to kill a mole,Great product.  The best way to kill a mole.  I bought these traps on-line only because I couldn't find them in the stores.  I've killed 3 this month.  6 for the summer.  Well worth the money.
A1VUWMHMWWAT35,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Excellent mole trap,"I work as a groundsman and a large Seattle facility and was forced to take action to combat our mole problem.  Unfortunately mole trapping is illegal in Washington (damn liberals) but sometimes you have to bend the law!  The trap has a very strong spring as is more than capable of squishing moles with ease.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Do not bother with the enclosed prongs.  The trap is easy to set if you use some creativity.  Drop the trap onto the grass (not dirt or pavement) and step on the jaws to get them shut in order to set the lever.  You have to use your body weight to do this.  Some people have said these traps are difficult to set.  They are a piece of cake to set if you do it this way.<br /><br />If the tunnel is on the surface, just use a knife (like a drywall knife) to make the slits in the ground and insert the legs of the trap.  Of course you will have to squish a small amount of tunnel down for the trigger to be right next to the earth.<br /><br />If the tunnel is a few inches down, dig a small section of the tunnel out (like 6 inches), place the trap inside, and fill it with loose soil.  The moles with try to make their way through the tunnel but will inevitably push up slightly on the trigger, causing their most unfortunate death.  Occassionally they will still be alive so be prepared for angry moles!  I will note that this is the #1 trap recommended by ""moleman"", just google the name.<br /><br />I have been trapping for about a month and have caught five moles so far.  Three big ones, two small ones.  Our grass is saved!"
A12AVN3ANT09NE,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Worked Perfectly,"I found a video review that helped me quickly figure out how to set the trap.  It was not hard at all.  Yes, the spring is very powerful, and therefore it's hard to get the jaws opened and locked.  However, the provided tools and proper technique make it easy.<br /><br />I had a dozen or more tunnels in a 15' x 25' area of my yard.  I picked one tunnel that seemed fairly straight, hoping it was one that was used over and over by the critter(s).  I set the trap, (which took less than 5 minutes), placed a bucket over it, and went back inside.  2 hours later I came back out and looked under the bucket. I was surprised to see the trap was already sprung.  I was even more surprised to see a mole in the jaws when I pulled it out of the ground!  What more could you ask for?"
A10XO2J8PCFGYH,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,First mole in under 12 hours,"I realize after looking at images online, that I didn't even set this properly, but it worked. The dirty mole which has been wreaking havoc on my lawn is finally dead and gone! That said, this trap is pretty humane. It's very difficult to open, requiring a lot of strength, so that mole was crushed and probably died very quickly."
A1QQBXWG3SU8WR,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Hard to cock, but it never misses. It's a long-time favorite because it works.","I've tried 3 other mole-trap designs with limited to no success. Without a doubt, this is the trap that gets the job done, every time. I have always used the simple directions supplied with the trap, with no customizations.<br /><br />This is a powerful trap that works fast.  The cocking process may require more coordination and strength than some folks can provide. However, once the trap is armed, and the berm under the trigger is at the right height, you are virtually guaranteed to get your critter from either direction as it pushes dirt to close the hole.  I use a post-hole digger to dig a clean right-sized hole, then cover everything with an inverted plastic bucket.  Just follow the directions on the box."
AFJXN66SGQNF4,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,No luck yet,"I bought 5 of these traps hoping to rid myself of the moles in my yard.  First off, they are difficult to set.  It requires some strength in order to set the trap.  So far, the moles simply seem to avoid the trap.  One was triggered but the mole avoided the trap somehow.  I haven't caught a thing; I'd try a different trap next time."
A5L2R0E2KXZ2Q,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Moles No More,I bought these traps due to the good reviews and the price of the item.  I followed the directions of the guy that tells all of his mole stories which is pretty awesome and entertaining in the review section.  I set my traps and had my first Mole within a day!!  I thought my problems were solved but they came back and I got a second within a day!!  They then showed up in the front lawn and I didn't set the trap right and It took a few days to realize my mistake but after I reset the trap I got my third mole and I've been mole free for a couple of weeks!!!  I would encourage people to get this product.  It does take a decent amount of strength to set the traps but they work and thats all I care about.
A3TB6R3X2R3W8W,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It works!,"Anyone who has had moles needs help. After 30+ bombs, I enlisted help from a neighbor who schooled me in mole habits and we got a kill. I assumed multiple moles because of the number of mounds but it was only one. I have my own trap on the way."
A1SWP7ZXCBLFW2,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Best Mole Trap Ever,"I bought two of these two years ago.  First year I didn't need it since the moles left me alone.  This year however I have set it twice and caught a mole each time.  I'd previously tried other types of mole traps, i.e. spikes and hoops but with limited success.  (Seemes I had too many misses, sprung trap but no catches).  Having grown up on a farm and traping several types of critters I figured I knew how to trap moles too.  I felt strongly about this trap today after my second success in just two settings that I looked up my two year old purchase and wrote this.<br /><br />Aug. 19th, 2011<br />Mole #3 today.  So far I've made three sets and caught three moles.  Not a miss yet.  This type of trap is definately the best of any I've tried previously."
ASEB4OTLFYK0C,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Effective!,"I chose this based on reviews.  It's not available locally in stores, and I learned that my mole problem would not be fixed using gopher/mole bait.<br /><br />This trap is fairly large.  It's all-metal with a VERY strong spring.  It's not the easiest thing to set, requiring a fair amount of force, and you need to be very careful with it.  If you catch a finger in it, I have no doubt you'd break it and you'd have a very difficult time trying to get out of it with only one working hand, so use care!!!<br /><br />The instructions could be a little more clear, but the trap is easy to figure out how it works once you examine it and set it once.  You do need to find a good location to set it, and make sure to create the mound in the middle that rests very closely to the trigger.  It only takes about 10 minutes to set once you figure it out.  I can probably do it under 5 minutes now.<br /><br />I suggest covering the trap with an upside down plastic pot with a weight on top to block out the light and to keep kids and other animals from accidentally getting into to it.  While the jaws will be below ground, it's still not something you'd want to trip or step on just in case.<br /><br />I set three of these traps along with 2 pairs of Trapline (check them out too... you'll have to search for them yourself... it's a California thing), not certain which would work and I was quite determined to get rid of my mole problem ASAP once it (or they) dug over 20 holds in my new lawn in 2 days.  The next morning... already caught the mole!  It was trap cleanly around the hips.  It wasn't a bloody mess at all, but it probably died from a combination of internal injuries, a broken spine, and asphyxiation.  Regardless, it was VERY dead.<br /><br />Bottom line... this trap is EFFECTIVE.  And that's the best I could ask for.  I probably have an overkill of traps, but I have extensive tunneling in my yard and wanted to catch the mole quickly before it did more damage.  I LOVE this trap and highly recommend it!"
A1323Y1U2XEWTY,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole Trapper,"I'm not sure why they call this the ""out-O'site mole trap"".  Although the actual mechanism that traps the mole is under ground, the top part (about 4 to 5 inches) still is above the ground.  I recommend that you cover it with a small plastic pail or flower pot, so other animals or kids don't set it off inadvertently.  So, far I haven't trapped a mole, but I think it's because I haven't set is in an area that the moles are currently active in.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RAMY"">Victor 0631 Out O'Sight Mole Trap</a>"
A1YQ8XV9JDYXTK,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caught a mole in 5 minutes,"Wow, I am impressed.  Read all the reviews and thought this trap sounded like a good bet for my mole woes.  Put 3 into the ground following other's tips and caught a mole in 5 MINUTES!!!  I kid you not.  By the time I put the shovel away, took off my shoes, and looked out my window one of the traps had sprung.  I thought it was because I put it in wrong!  Nope, dead mole - right there in the trap.  These things rule!"
A2CS0ZTHRO5U3C,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Heavy duty - really works well,"I purchased several of the Victor 0631 mole traps and have had great success with trapping the moles that have been tearing up our yard. The spring on it is massive, which gives the trap enough strength to cut through any type of soil conditions when it is triggered. The trap is much easier to set if you use a large pair of channel lock pliers. You will want to use caution when handling the the loaded trap - once it is set, you don't want to get anywhere near the jaws, as it will be a guaranteed visit to the hospital. I also use the channel lock pliers to put the trap in position over the mole tunnel to give myself plenty of distance from the moving parts. I have also tried the Nash Choker Loop and the Sweeney Plunger trap. I catch about 3 moles with the Victor trap for every one that I get with the Nash trap. In damp sandy soil, I have seen the Nash trap not being able to trip quick enough because the spring doesn't quite have the oomph behind it to cut through the dirt. As far as the Sweeney trap goes, I have yet to get my first mole after 3 years of using it."
A3O2E3SF0N7IEO,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Got one on my first try.,"After reading some of the reviews, it seems like a lot of people have had success with these traps, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was still skeptical, because that's my nature, but I'm not anymore. I installed the trap using the method of stepping on the mole tunnel to flatten it and cutting slits in the grass for the trap's scissors. The very next day I noticed the trap had tripped and I went to see if I caught one. Sure enough, when I pulled the trap out, there was the bane of my yard. A big, fat, ugly sucker with huge claws designed for yard devastation. I felt a little bad because I love most animals, but this one deserved what he got. Anyway, these traps are awesome. I cannot believe how good they work. Happy hunting."
A3DCTE9K8UQ01V,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Actually worked,"I didn't have high expectations for this but it worked so I'll share what I did:<br /><br />I stamped down ALL of the tunnels in the yard the evening before.  The next morning I looked for new tunnel, especially long straight ones because apparently those are the ones most travelled.  I then placed the trap on said tunnel and I had a dead mole within two hours.  Like a previous reviewer, I did not follow the manufacturers instructions and instead followed his which I reccomend doing because it's not only easier but also works."
AF5KXHJ44MQCC,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caught one the first night on mole super highway.,"You must find the mole 'highways' which are the long straight runs that (for me) were easiest found beside the patio, sidewalk, or driveway.  Once you think you have identified one, simply mash down about a 2 foot long section.  My thought process was that if I pressed down the entire run, they might find an alternate route.<br /><br />So once you do this, check back in 24-48 hours to see if has been repaired.  If it has, then mash down a section the length of your foot, LEVEL with the rest of the surrounding grounds.  I have sand soil so I simply dug (with my finger) 2 small notches ACROSS the mole highway same distance apart as the trap death grips.<br /><br />I found it easy to set the trap by hand, using the directions on the box... but many other reviews here offer alternative methods.  Leave the 2 bars used to pry the trap open in place, it helps to position the trap in the ground.  Now, set the trap death grips down in the notches you have created (with SAFETY latch hooked!) The trigger plate should touch the LEVEL ground that you mashed down.  Keep a firm grip on the pry bars as the trap may trigger a few times until you get it touching the ground with light enough pressure not to trigger.  When you are happy, remove the pry bars, release the safety and enjoy the results.<br /><br />Start > Finish, of setting trap, maybe 3 minutes.<br /><br />My soil is pure sand, so my 'notches' mentioned above were almost non-existent because they kept back filling with sand as soon as I dug them out with my finger.  When I set the trap, the soil was in between the death grips, but it was loose enough to grab the mole, first night I had set the trap!<br /><br />Great trap, easy to use and set.  I may have had some beginners luck, but so far so good."
A175XHWAWNSZV0,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Works perfectly with usage advice found on here!,"I bought these a few months ago... finally got around to using them this week.  Trapped one mole within 24 hours.  I just bought two more traps.  I am going to deploy all four and see what I get next.  Also caught a vole with regular mouse traps... thanks to these Victor traps I am hopefully on my way to ridding my yard of piles of dirt (moles) and chewed up grass and plants (voles), and saving the hundreds of dollars a service would charge for this... it is so simple."
A1UDSVUOIN38H,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"best way to kill moles.  Like all traps, it must be set correctly.","These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight"
A12JPICDHNQTXC,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caught my first mole within 3 hours of setting the trap.,"Woo hoo!  I'm so excited to have caught a mole so quickly after setting the traps for the first time.  I purchased two traps and set them up like Geoffrey Klos suggested.  I couldn't find any runs that looked like ""highways"", but I did find some that snaked around my yard and seemed to connect the myriad of smaller runs that branched out.  I guess my instincts were correct.  When I noticed that the trap had been set off, I took my shovel with me, fully prepared to whack that mole on its head if it were alive. I was not prepared for it to be so cute and fuzzy, so I now have a live mole in a bucket.  I guess that's better than a live mole in my front yard.  The only problem is I now have to figure out how to get rid of the cute little monster.  Needless to say, the trap worked great.  The trap is probably best set with two people:  one to use the levers to open the jaws and the other to position the safety hook and the tripping rod.  I set it by myself in two steps.  First I layed it on its side and stepped on the top lever until I could lock the safety hook.  At that point, the levers were close enough together that I could squeeze them with one hand while setting the tripping rod and tripping pan. I noticed the pictures that looked like someone had dug two trenches in which to place the legs of the trap, but I just followed Klos's instructions and used a small spade to make four puncture holes that lined up with the legs, and then I pressed the trap down into the holes until the tripping pan touched the dirt that I had previously patted down with my foot.  Happy mole hunting!"
A2SL3D4N374HAW,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Set twice, killed twice","This product worked way better than I thought it would, even after reading all the positive reviews. I set it in the run used by an evil mole who repeatedly crossed my back yard on his way next door. I sprayed his run with castor oil products, Murphy soap, water with cayenne pepper powder in it--nothing phased this monster. Set this trap in his main highway, and next day, it had snagged the pest. Two days later found another mole run entering from another neighbor's yard. Set the trap, next morning, dead mole.<br /><br />I'm not bloodthirsty, but these creeps ruin my yard. I stopped short of cutting off their heads and sticking them on Popsicle sticks next to the runs. I did, though, leave the bodies buried securely in the tunnels. A message for any other intruders.<br /><br />A big thanks to Geoffrey Klos for his excellent instructions. Doubt I would have been successful following the package's instructions."
A3D7NKQGLKLBFO,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Awesome! Must Have!,"Not much else to say, but this really works!  I set the trap and 2 hours later = dead mole!  Can't ask for more than that.  Easy to set up, easy to reset!"
A1KMZRULWJJ0SS,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,mole eliminator,gets all moles big or small. i have found putting a small dirt clod under paddle helps trigger trap. if you have dogs you can put a bucket over trap and weight it down once trap is set to keep them out also keeps children out. i have two and my brother also has two and we both agree that they are the best thing on the market today.
AHJ4SWXMUTXEL,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"They work, but one of my traps had a major, dangerous manufacturing flaw!!","I purchased 3 of these from Amazon. They do work. So far, I have caught 2 moles in my yard and 1 in my neighbor's using the surface technique. One of the traps though has a dangerous manufacturing flaw. The thinner piece of metal on the top of the trap where the trigger bar and safety clip are attached broke on the trap after setting it only twice. I have also observed that over time and constant use the paint wears off this piece and the metal rusts, further weakening it. I have contacted Victor about this problem but have not yet heard back from them. Thankfully Amazon has a very liberal and easy return policy on defective items. See pic of broken trap in customer images.<br /><br />I would have rated this higher but Victor has quality control issues they need to address. This is what happens when you outsource your manufacturing to other countries like China.<br /><br />For those having problems setting these traps, don't follow the instructions on the box. See my pics in customer images on how to set these without having to use a vice or vice-grips."
ATS4HBF274CC1,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Good trap, requires strong hands","I've been very successful at trapping moles with this trap. It was a little hard to figure out how to set it initially---the directions on the box aren't perfectly clear--but finally figured it out. It does require pretty good hand strength to set it. I used a 2 x 4 to prop the jaws of the trap open until I figured out how to set it. This trap was one of the few recommended by ""The Mole Man"" [...], whose web site it really great for learning about mole biology, habitat and how to control moles. Traps appear to be the only effective method. And this trap is certainly effective. I caught a mole the first night the trap was out and several more since."
A5MIWVIFLX74H,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It works,"After following Geoff Klos's instruction, got the first mole in two weeks.  Thanks for sharing the technique.  This product works, but patience is the key.  It's a bit difficult to set, but in order to provide the clamping force and speed required, I guess it's necessary to have such strong spring."
A658UZTHK6GQ3,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Best mole trap I've found,"I've used two other types of traps besides this one: the plunger style (stabbing death from above) and the scissor style with foot activation (cut 'em in half). Neither worked very well--the scissor/foot style frustrated me the most because you have to compress the springs using your foot after the trap is positioned, and if the soil is somewhat damp, the whole trap will just squash into the ground.<br /><br />After the snow melted I discovered that the moles had been hard at work in my yard. I set the Victor trap on what I believed to be one of the mole ""highways"" and caught a critter WITHIN 6 HOURS. He was a big one too, almost 6 inches from nose to tail.<br /><br />PROS of the Victor trap:<br />* I like that you can set/compress the trap before you place it. This makes it easy to position it exactly how you want it in the ground.<br />* The safety catch is a nice feature. If you hit the trigger lever by accident, you won't hurt yourself.<br />* Trigger lever is VERY sensitive. This has been one of my frustrations with other traps--I can sometimes tell by the soil movement that moles are passing under it without tripping it.<br />* Price, $10 is cheaper than most other traps.<br /><br />CONS of the Victor trap:<br />* The instructions stink. Even disregarding the placement issue (see next point), it took me a few minutes to figure out how to compress the trap using the ""setting levers"" and trigger lever. It's a good design, just not well documented.<br />* Don't use the instructions on the box for placing the trap. I followed the advice of several other reviewers here who suggest cutting notches on either side of the tunnel for the trap blades to rest in. This turned out to be easier and more effective.<br /><br />If they just improved the instructions on the box, it'd be a five star review from me."
A2XKDZYX5X4KTB,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caught one!,"I don't care what anyone else says about this trap because I just caught one and I've been trying for years. First day I set it out it worked. My area is very sandy and I consider the spear/plunger type traps a total rip off, for me anyway. Never caught one til I got this trap.. These moles are very destructive to my plants. I've read all the mumbo jumbo from the go green guys about how moles just eat grubs and help aerate the soil. Yeah right! They have killed fruit trees and plowed down whole rows of my vegetable garden.. By whatever means they manage to kill my plants.. So I hope to kill more with this trap.."
APFJVJMKAUTCW,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Great Mole Getter,"Looked all over and read many reviews. This trap just works! Got it this morning and put it in like the pictures show. Snap, one dead mole three hours later. Now to get the rest of the clan as well."

Next morning one of the traps was sprung, and sure enough, I got my first kill! I'm sold!"
A2YA5ORUK9L42T,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Problem setting,"I can't figure out how to load the trap.  It comes with two metal levers which you're to use to set the spring, this ""will require some strength""!  I would sent it back but I beleive there is a 20% restocking fee."

A1D95SK84X58RW,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The ONLY solution that works!!,I have been battling moles for over 3 years. They have completely destroyed our lanscape. I tried everything I could find and was recommended to me. My brother had a Victor Trap he would lend to me when he wasn't using it. I got 4 in 2 weeks. I've looked everywhere for these traps but couldn't find them in stores. I found them on Amazon.com and bought 2. If you have mole issues I promise you this product will work.<br /><br />Happy Hunting!
A27RFRTUEKUWXJ,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor Mole Trap review,"While I haven't had success with the traps, I did get them in the fall and I understand the better time to use them is the spring.  The traps were exactly what I expected though - high quality, appear to be durable, and are easy to set.  They were delivered pretty quick, too."
A2OMQ6PFNLHSA2,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,they're hard to catch,I think the trap is effective if you can outsmart a mole.  I have only caught one in the last two months with three traps.  I think the number of moles I have with the vast number of runs make it difficult.  I may have to order a dozen of these traps to up my odds.
A31FEB2ZZD8SP8,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole elimination,"Moles were devastating my lawn and I had tried the grub killer which had little effect on their havoc. I ordered 3 victor traps, when I opened the first trap I struggled to set it. I thought as hard as it is to set this trap I won't be using them. Then I opened the second box and found it easy to set, the first one had the latch fabricated on the wrong side. Within a week I had caught three moles now I am moving on to other sections of the lawn. Return of the defective trap was also a very painless task."

A3OAFXXHLXWBK4,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Worked for me!!,"I live in upstate NY and I had a mole destroying my lawn with zig zagging tunnels. I went online, did some research, and ended up ordering one victor out of sight mole trap. I could not locate any straight tunnels so i had to put it on curvy tunnels. I did what reviewers had said, and i flattened the tunnel, put two slits across where the claws rest and set the trigger at ground level. I got nothing for about 3 weeks, even after moving the trap around tunnel to tunnel. I started to lose faith in the trap. So one day I tried a different method, more of what the instructions say...i openned up one of the tunnels(6 inch length) and stuck the trap inside and put the trigger just above where his head would be in the tunnel. I then covered the base of the trap and hole back up with dirt. Within two days the trap was sprung and to my amazement I had a large dead mole in the trap!!! I couldnt of been happier!! I am not sure if the new way I set the trap was how I got him, or if that was just coincidence. Either way it works. I just ordered another trap, as I think if you have two or more your chances of getting them is much better. After you kill one, new ones will move in shortly after, so you will use the traps over and over..."
A2JP9E1H0SF392,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The ONLY trap you need!!!  Simply AWESOME.,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap, you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.<br /><br />What you need to do:<br />1- bend the trigger down a little<br />2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.<br />3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.<br />4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.<br /><br />Once I figured this trap out, I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!<br /><br />***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are ""leghold, steel-jawed traps"".  I will be going to court soon..."
A3VDKQIA081MDX,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Ordered 2 items, one was defective","I ordered 2 of these traps in the spring.  The mole runs tend to show up only in the late summer/fall where I live, and I finally opened them up to use them.  One of the traps did not have a trigger pan, so it is useless.  I have just set the other one, but would sure like to get the other one replaced, but it would appear that due to the passage of time, I am no longer able to get a refund/replacement for the defective on."

Thanks Mr. Klos, your great review has saved my lawn.<br /><br />15 Aug update:  Second mole is dead and I haven't seen another one since.  I did have one of the arms on the trap break--not sure how it happened since I noticed it when the trap was not in use.  Amazon replaced within days."
A363WIYGGG7GIN,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,This works,"I lived in my house for 3 years with no moles.  Spent several housand dollars landscaping the front yard and in move the moles.  I tried to chase them away with castor oil and other anti-mole products with no results.  I purchased 2 traps last night and read the reccomendations from online readers for setup. Do not follow the directions on the box.  The next morning, both traps had caught a mole a piece.  Great product!"
AZGX3HLDS95ED,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,No More Moles,"After 4 years of sprays, grub insecticide and plunger traps I finally found a product that works.  I never caught one mole in 4 years even though the old traps had been set off dozens of times.  I had tried the castor oil spray and treated the lawn for grubs and my lawn looked worse than ever.  I purchased 3 of these traps and caught 4 moles in the first two weeks.  I used the above ground method described by other reviewers and only one time was the trap tripped with no mole in its jaws.  An excellent product."
AQ9QM12AZWGJ9,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,BEST trap for Moles,A little difficult to set but well worth the effort.<br /><br />I have had 2 missed trips and 16 kills.

A2TQR93PX6N36U,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It really works!,"I purchased 3 of the Victor mole traps and followed the instructions and caught a mole the first time I set them.

A3FUQC86O886LJ,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor out-o-sight mole traps,The Victor Out-o-sight mole trap does not work. I have been using three of them for about a month now and they do not work. The moles just dig around them. I followed all of the directions from this guy Jon in Oregon and have not caught one mole. Nothing catches moles. They are creatures from hell. Pardon me. But that is just the way it seems. I believe that this guy Jon from Oregon is nothing more than a pitch-man for these traps. It is NOT the fault of Amazon. They did their job. But the traps do not. Don't buy these traps.

A13MZXSW22CGMG,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set,"This trap is effective.  It misses a 5 star rating because it can be difficult to set.  The Victor 0631 works well if you are willing to take 5-10 minutes to clearance the blade slots in the soil yourself and then set the trap ""just right"".  It may go off on you the first few times after you set it in the ground, so be prepared to set it multiple times.  It has a safety catch so it won't alarm you too much if it goes off when you place it in the ground.<br /><br />The Wire Tek 1001 is double the money but is set by simple foot operation which expands the blades, thus self-clearancing the soil blade slots.  The Victor 0631 is made in China which does not please me.  The Wire Tek 1001 is made in the USA and is more rugged.  Its clamping force is double as it has two springs which allows it to close very quickly and with authority.  Grass and roots will not interfere with the Wire Tek's effectiveness."
ANOQD96JX3IR0,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,These traps work BUT you have to set them right,"I have tried using these traps from time to time for over a year unsuccessfully.  But, after reading some of the reviews here for the other Victor Out O' Sight trap, I realized I wasn't setting them right.  And, I caught one mole yesterday, and another today.  So, I'm excited that I've finally come up with a way to catch them.<br /><br />I'm sharing my technique for setting them in the hope it will help you:<br />  1) Find an active tunnel.  You can just walk around the yard and step down on raised areas, then come back later and see if they get raised up again.<br />  2) Cut a couple of scrap pieces of wood that are 3/8"" or 1/2"" thick by four or five inches long, by say, five or six inches high. You'll use these to hold the grooves you cut for the trap legs when you push down on the soil.<br />  4) Get a garden tool that can cut down through any roots, like a hatchet, or a flat-blade tool with wooden shaft and a handle (don't know what you call it, but that's what I use).<br />  5) Get a tool you can use to find the center of the tunnel.  I use a discarded mop handle that I drilled a hole in the end of and glued in a six inch nail.<br />  6) Probe the tunnel to approximately locate it's center, and just leave it sticking in the center for now.<br />  7) Set the trap on the ground along the tunnel near where you will place it so you can see how far apart to cut the grooves for the trap legs.<br />  8) Cut the first groove for the trap legs as clean as you can; then, feel down in the cut line to locate the tunnel. Use a finger to locate the tunnel.<br />  9) Stick one of your scrap pieces of wood in this groove, and tap it down firmly.<br />  10) Then cut the other groove so the other legs will go in it.<br />  11) Again, run a finger down in this cut to locate the other end of the tunnel.  You do this because the tunnel may turn some, and you'll need to turn your trap too.<br />  12) Stick the other scrap piece of wood in it.<br />  11) Now, step down with your heel between the two pieces of scrap wood. You want this dirt to be very firm.  I do this, then also tap down with the end of my flat blade tool to get it extra firm.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br />  12) Next, wiggle the two pieces of wood back and forth, and in and out to open up the two grooves a little, them pull them out.<br />  13) Set the trap into the two grooves while observing the clearance between the ground and the traps bottom lever. You don't want it to contact the ground or you'll spring the trap.  Incidentally, you should have the trap safety ON at this point.<br />  14) Now, use a finger to feel the clearance between the ground and the lever; and, push and/or tap the trap down slowly until it is only 1/16th inch or so from the ground.<br />  15) Release the trap's safety.  I repeat: Release the trap's safety.  I seem to frequently forget to do this.<br />  16) Take some loose soil or leaves and just drop them around the trap legs to prevent sunlight from getting down to the tunnel.<br />  17) GOOD LUCK!"
ADBZZKMY9DZ11,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Dissatisfied,"The trap is difficult to set.  It requires a lot of physical exertion, and it is very awkward to set. The trigger mechanism goes from hard to spring to a hair trigger. Thumbs down on this one!"
AGOAD5OO1IPMJ,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,needs some improvements,"This trap is VERY powerful. Easy to set, but needs improvement to trip lever. It needs wide flat piece on it, to prevent mole from slipping by. I have yet to nab one. Srarted using small, thin piece of wood, placed right under trip lever, bending lever did no good, dirt was just pushed up around it. Takes some practice getting it placed in position, need a sharp shooter that has been flattened out on the end. Great idea, just keep improving it."
A3PJRR03ZAFWGR,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,doesn't work or just hard to set up? maybe both!,"I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek ""EasySet"" Mole Trap here on Amazon, and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor ""Out O'Sight"" Mole Trap is not only 1) much more difficult to operate but also 2) less effective than the Wire-Tek one, not to mention 3) tears up your yard more.  With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire-Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it, easy as pie.  That one has caught 2 moles for me so far, the Victor trap has caught 0 moles.  If it wasn't such a hassle to ship stuff back, I'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap.  Don't waste your time on this product here!"
A2AEXLZW7QEEHH,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Don't buy this trap,"Unless you have the strength of superman, it is impossible to set this trap.<br />The jaws need to be pulled apart by using pry bars. I could not do it, and I am not a weak man. I did manage to set it once by using a vice, but even that took some doing because the pry rods would slip out of place.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I had a friend who is a martial arts expert specializing in grabbing things and holding on (yes there is such a specialty). The normal adult male has a gripping strength of 80-100PSI. Dave J has a gripping strength of 350PSI. He struggled and struggled, thought he could do it, but I took it away from him before he hurt himself.<br /><br />The design is bad. The trap is almost impossible to set without using a vice.<br />If I had ever gotten it in the ground it might have worked (it definitely would kill if tripped appropriately) but the thing is just too hard to set.<br /><br />PS I got on the victor customer support site and requested help. They sent me a pdf that was exactly the same as the diagram on the box....no help.  A second email to them has gone unanswered for 3 days.<br /><br />I shipped it back today"

Watched the videos, read the excellent reviews, etc. Still can't get the thing to stay cocked-just releases itself before you can even get to the safety latch. Never even got close to putting them in the ground-I bought 3 of them and now I get to pay the shipping back. By the time I box them up, take them to shipping just to get the remainder of my money back-might as well just throw them away and save the aggravation. Go for it if you feel lucky."

A2U2OI1GO30KRX,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Does not work in sandy soil,Live in Florida and bought 4 of these traps based on the reviews here. This trap seems rather large for the size moles we have here in Florida. The tunnels which I could find are no bigger than 1 inch. The soil is so sandy that the trigger gets covered up and the tunnels collapse when trying to set this trap. I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off.<br />As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off. The traps were placed with the trigger in the tunnel so the moles would go under it and trigger the trap.<br />Anyone living in a hot sandy soil area who has found a trap that will work please post.
A3CN6VB6OT9QTM,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Question about usage!,"Can't I just leave the critter in the ground?  I'm feeling squeamish about pulling them up for disposal, but I can hardly walk in my yard for fear of twising an ankle the runs are so bad."
AWC7226K6TGCG,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Thanks,We haven't used them yet but have seen where they have been used and they work great.
A2T767TDEGUP5S,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Did not work for me,I'm hesistant to give the product this low rating but it simply did not work for me. I tried on 3 separate occasions and actually saw the critter go past the trap and trigger it. Only thing I can figure is the trap is too large for my moles. I also followed the preferred method of setting these out. I plan to try again but the next time I'm going to be prepared to take care of this critter with a pitch fork if I'm lucky enough again for him to drive by while I'm laying the trap out!
A1UGMRN67XIKGL,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Can't get it set...,"I bought two of the traps last month. I tried to get them set and in the ground. I spent about an hour trying to get the trap set, but it would not stick. I haven't taken the time to try and get them to work since then b/c the Grubex I put down seems to have slowed down the mole activity in my yard.<br /><br />I'll definately try to get them set again if the mole activity picks back up, but right now they are just collecting dust in my shed."

AOH6ISM0ZEYFU,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Very difficult to set,I bought 2 of these traps and spent an hour trying to set one of them.  I have decided the trigger mechanism must have been installed wrong when it was made.  No way this thing will work.  Sent them back.  Will buy another type/brand.  Save your money.
AKH0LJQ1FR2U2,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Not easy to set up! Too hard to use,"Of all of the several mole traps I purchased recently, this is my least favorite. It is the hardest to set up and requires some significant digging. The spring is very strong and requires some strength. In fact I never did get it set."
A3DC7Z9J5QPQBS,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Extremely hard to set!!!,"This device may work, but I have spent hours trying to set it with little success.  I finally got a large set of channel locks, got the trap to set, and attached the safety pin.  I set everything up for a few days with no results.  When I wanted to move it to another location, it closed so I had to start the process all over again.  As I said earlier, it may work but unless your superman you will have a difficult time setting this trap."
A16GUQL26IDGMW,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Use grub and insect killer instead,"We had mole tunnels throughout our lawn.  We first tried the non-lethal castor/garlic oil water spray method (twice).  It didn't work. Then we tried laying two of the Victor Out of Sight Mole Trap out.  That didn't work, either. Finally, my son spot movement in the lawn and he stomped on the tunnel.  The mole was dead. It was small, only about 4 inches.  But, it was amazing, that was the end of our problem.  Our entire lawn - which isn't small - was destroyed by ONE tiny mole.  Best advise, look for the movement of the mole in the late afternoon, than stomp on it or use a flat end of a large shovel. Moles have thin skulls so apparently they are easy to kill. One mole can do an incredible amount of damage.<br /><br />5/31/10 update:<br /><br />New season, new mole appears. Instead of using the mole trap, I tried a new approach--- kill his food source. One application of grub and insect killer and the mole is gone, probably to the neighbors yard. Everything I read on the internet suggest that you have to kill the mole but that has remained elusive except by luck. Getting rid of his food source though worked immediately. We never saw another tunnel after the grub and insect killer was applied over three weeks ago. We'll see how long it lasts but this was much easier than trying (unsuccesfully) to trap the mole."
A14A45ZLDXFGFY,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The Moles will be safe with this piece of junk,Don't waste your time buying this piece of junk. The instructions must have been done by a three year old and trap cannot be set as shown. Customer service people do not even repond to my inquiries.
A9PC5HJNGD22D,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Don't follow the directions,"Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those ""pockets"" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin..."
A3L1IKXS8FMF1J,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The only trap I've found that has worked for me!,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 5:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>This is the way I've had luck using this type of trap. I've killed over 35 moles from my yard this way but keep in mind that techniques may vary depending on your area and soil type."
A26OPNLJ0JYHPH,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The trap works if you DO NOT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS,"This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your ""out o sight"" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.<br /><br />When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as ""Mark the Mole Man"") came to our house, I showed him our ""out of sight"" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, ""Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'."" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.<br /><br />He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.<br /><br />Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.<br /><br />It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos."
A1IA3S7VCM8YT5,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,finally something that really works!!!,"after $100.00 in smoke bombs and spring loaded spike traps, we gave up on the mole invasion. we called and exterminator who used these same traps. they didn't miss. he caught six in two days. we found these traps on-line and ordered two. about a month later we saw another mole tunnel. next day we had him. be very careful setting these traps, they are very powerful. by the way, the exterminator gets $50.00 a mole."
A3GJE3EMH71IAB,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor 0631,"This is an excellent product. I had to play with the sensitivity of the trigger a bit before I used it. Once set, it worked very well. Trapped a couple of moles in 24 hours and problem has gone away now.<br /><br />I did not like the manufacturer's instructions. I had to find out how to set it myself. Here is what I did:<br /><br />1. Armed the trapped with the safety clip on.<br />2. Found a straight area on the mole's runway<br />3. Flattened a straight part of the runway a couple of inches wider that trap by stepping on it<br />4. Used a putty knife as wide as the trap jaws and cut two lines perpendicular to the run. I widened the cuts a bit for the jaws to push trough the cut easily<br />5. I pushed the trap jaws in the cuts until the trigger tip just touched the top part of the grass.<br />6. Removed the safety clip<br /><br />You can protect the trap if you are like me and have neighbors with kids and/or dog by covering the trap with a large bucket and a heavy weight on top of it."
A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,They work but can you bring yourself to use them?,"I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.<br /><br />  Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.<br /><br />  Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.<br /><br />  But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard."
A1ETWKC5XSPRE4,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Great Trap,"Great Product.  Made of strong durable metal.  Will last a long time.  I had best success by not using the product like explained on the box.  I used a shovel or axe to make slit in the ground for the ""clamps"" to fit into to secure a clean catch when tripped.  Before setting the traps walk on top of the raised tunnels to find the most active sites to know where to set the trap.  I have killed 5 moles in my yard in the first week.  Happy Hunting and Good Luck."
AIL1XBTPXH634,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caught in 3 days,"I've had at least one mole terrorizing my landscaping for about 8 months now.  I initially let him go, since he wasn't actually damaging plants.  In time, though, he'd separated enough roots from the soil that I nearly lost several plants, and my 20 ft crabapple was dropping half its leaves in June.  Something had to be done.  I'd read the reviews here early on, but decided to try some control methods that I could get locally.  This trap was not one of those.<br />I used three of the Victor harpoon-style mole traps, and managed to get them triggered successfully, but the mole escaped.  The design is simply flawed--in pushing the harpoon downward, the trap tends to force itself out of the ground.  To help prevent this, the trap has very long stakes that need to be driven into the ground... if you have much gravel in your soil, like I do, this is nearly impossible.<br />Several states' university extensions have tested the relatively new gummy-worm style baits with reasonable success, so I decided to try them.  Because my moles ""highway"" tunnels were right next to my house under plastic, I was able to peel back the plastic and drop them right into the tunnels (the plastic made up the roof of the tunnels).  I checked them each day for two days and my mole was actually eating them.  I had to leave town for a week, and when I got back there had been no new mole activity, which was not normal for my busy guy. I figure the gummy worms did him in.<br />Unfortunately, another mole invaded about 2 weeks later--completely different habits, though--this one preferred the lawn over the landscaping beds.  I'd ordered these traps the same day I placed the gummy worms, so I set three Out O'Sight traps per the instructions given by other reviewers (NOT THE ONES PROVIDED).  In three days I had my new mole.<br />One additional method of locating active tunnels that I like to use is to poke a stick through the top of an existing tunnel that you suspect might be a ""highway"".  Place a stone over the hole to block out the light.  Check under the stone daily--if the hole is filled in, the mole has passed through again.  Set your trap there.<br />Given the choice, I prefer these traps over the baits for two reasons--no poisons in your yard to accidentally get your neighbor's cat, and there's a little mole body to confirm that you actually got him.  Just be prepared--the little critters are actually kinda cute.<br /><br />Familiarize yourself with their habits, follow the instructions given by the others here, and be patient, and you'll have your moles."
A21X8J556IOC8L,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It Worked for Me,"As many other reviewers, I had tried pellets, castor oil repellent, giant smoke bombs (two packages), and a sonic mole chaser to no avail. Every morning during the summer I would surely wake up to fresh mole hills and pebbles on our front yard, and I was losing the war. Then I purchased the Out of Sight trap on Amazon based on reviews and because it was available through Amazon Prime. Also, surprisingly no mole traps were available at my local Home Depot and OSH stores.<br /><br />After placing the trap in three different locations over the span of a week, I finally nailed the bugger. Here are some tips that I learned on my own or from various sites on the Internet:<br /><br />(1) Many of the reviewers on Amazon said that they encountered only shallow mole runs that were visible on the surface. They cited a good technique to set the trap for the shallow runs. However, my mole burrowed only deep runs. No runs were visible from the surface; only the mole hills. To set the trap for the deep runs, I followed the directions on the box, which called for digging a hole along a main run. I had to dig around 6 inches to get down to the run. Then, just as the directions say, I created a ""speed bump"" and filled the hole with some very loose soil. Then I placed a large 39 oz coffee can on top of the hole and trap. In fact, the coffee can made for a good template to carve out the hole, which should not be much wider in diameter than the length of the trap.<br /><br />(2) I found out on some website (I don't recall which) that when you first get the Out of Sight trap that you should stick it in dirt for a couple of days so that the odor of the freshly machined trap metal, which the mole can apparently smell, gets diffused. I don't know if that is fact or fiction, but my first unsuccessful experience with the trap seems to support that theory. The mole kicked dirt into the hole where I first placed the trap and also plugged up the runs leading to the trap. Smart little critter!<br /><br />(3) I found that a good tool to locate the main runs was a weed remover. The tip of the weed remover is thin enough to poke into the turf, but thick enough to have you sense whether you are still poking through dirt, which may be loose, or have discovered a run. Keep in mind that the main runs are still only around 1-1/2"" in diameter. The key to placing the trap is to find an active, main run.<br /><br />(4) If you have deep mole runs (like I experienced), a good way to locate them is to draw a straight line between adjacent, new mole hills. There is a good likelihood that there is a run that connects the mole hills. Place the trap between the adjacent mole hills, but more than 18 inches away from either mole hill. If you place the trap within close proximity to a mole hill, you will invariably just get dirt thrown into the trap by the mole.<br /><br />(5) Once a mole is trapped, you may get another mole (or some other critter) moving into its place. Moles are individualists. They stay away from other moles, but take over a territory when there is no other mole present. Moles do, however, get together in the spring when they mate. So, even after a kill, stay attentive to your lawn.<br /><br />In conclusion, I attest to this trap and its quality. It should last a long, long time. I would not allow my wife or a child to use the trap, however. As others noted, the spring is heavy duty and takes a fair amount of strength and courage to set. Also, it can be dangerous, and a set trap needs to be handled very carefully and with the safety latch on.<br /><br />Now that I got my mole, I can wake up without the anticipation of me having to rake over mole hills and replug grass. Also, now that I am confident about using the trap (I have one kill under my belt!), I am assured that if another bugger shows up (and one surely will), I know how to effectively deal with it."
A3VLKX7W0N5AN6,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Worked the First Night!,"I have recurring mole problems, lost count how many years now. Tried many things, but only this ""Out of Sight"" worked. This is my story:<br />1) First encounter years ago, surprise, what's up with these bumps?<br />2) Just tidy up the surface. Never mind that.<br />3) Ran water down the tunnel until water came out the other end. Very satisfying, but just a waste of water. Made the whole place muddy and the creature liked it even more.<br />4) Invested in a plunger type trap. Expensive and reusable, sounded good. Not quite. I was excited the first time it triggered, got my gloves on and plastic bag ready. The spikes went down a couple inches, but no catch. Tried a few more times with the same result. Even tied bricks on the top half, but the trap became unbalanced and did not plunge well. Trashed it.<br />5) Poison ""peanut"". Do not like poisons, but maybe just for this one. Carefully dropped nuts into tunnels as directed. No noticable result, but creature was gone late fall. Used it again early next season, at which time I concluded that it did not work. The creature likes worms and bugs, not deadly smelling chemical.<br />6) Wire type trap (like a rat trap). It fits inside the tunnel. Hard to use - the trap is directional and the tunnel must be disturbed for the deployment. My creature ran over or around it, never triggering it. The creature probably hit trap's frame and changed course. Would have been better if the trap is narrower and fits into a 1.5"" tunnel.<br />7) Saw it digging undergroud once (just once). Drove a pitch fork down mercilessly. Missed.<br />8) Lastly, the ""Out of Sight"". The size of the spring alone is impressive - WARNING: bone crushing spring force! Even my normally curious coworkers refused to play with it when my order arrived at the office. Set trap as directed the first night. At 3:30AM, a snap woke me up; continued to sleep, but with a smile on my face. The next morning, voila, face to face for the first time.<br /><br />I have a video of this last episode, may upload it later.<br /><br />Hints:<br />1) Creature likes wet area. It is most active right after watering. For the purpose of trapping, you can make a tunnel ""flavorable"" by keeing it moist between watering.<br />2) Creature works day and night, just not when you are looking.<br />3) Size your creature. Mine (I live in SoCal) turned out to be small like a fresh sausage. It explains why my pitch fork missed and the wire trap was too big."
A119DJPIG3XFL0,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Simple, effective and durable trap","First of all, do not follow the instructions in the box. Instead read some of these reviews for very good tips.<br />I got two moles in about five days. It took me a little bit to learn where and how to set it. I pretty much followed the good advise given in other post, I recommend you do the same, their method works.<br />Before this trap I tried a bunch of less-aggressive methods but to no avail. It is really hard to get rid of moles in a nice way. Finally I got fed up and went for a trap. Also, with a trap you can see the body of the critter and know for sure that you got it.<br />The trap has a simple-but-effective design, it is built of solid, black-painted iron and it is bigger and tougher than what I thought it was going to be from the product pictures, but it is not huge. The spring is very strong and I have to put my weight on it (using the provided levers) to set it (remember to use the locking hook).<br />The triggering mechanism is simple and reliable, although I used a file to round the edge of the holding ""stick"" to make it slide out easier of the trigger piece (added sensitivity) but be careful not to over-do it! or it will trigger by itself.<br />The trap stays out-of-sight in my backyard because it lays low and it is black. I added a bunch of tree leaves on top of it to make it invisible. The leaves don't interfere with its functioning.<br />The most difficult thing about setting this trap is placement. I'm still learning where is the most likely tunnel that the mole is going to use. I'm using little construction flags to mark tunnels that I step on to find out which tunnels are the most active.<br />One if the moles that it caught was still alive when I checked the trap, so bring a shovel with you in case you need it.<br />Also the price is very good compared to other very expensive traps.<br />I highly recommend this trap."
A1UKYN3LLIE6G5,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It does what the reviews said,"Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no ""natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!"
A1AI4MFW9INLTD,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Trap works,"I have 3 different kind of traps -  plunger, choker and Victor out of Sight.<br /><br />I have never caught anything with the plunger but have had great success with choker and out of sight.<br />Geoffrey Klos' review is great but I had success burying the trap and here's how:<br /><br />1. Take knife and cut top off straight mole run the size of trap and set aside to replace turf later.<br /><br />2. Dig section out a little deeper than tunnel.<br /><br />3. Mound dirt up in center where trigger mechanism will sit on without setting itself off.<br /><br />4. Lay turf and spread loose soil around trap to fill in gaps<br /><br />5.

AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Success In Five Hours,"Update June 3, 2011<br />More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.<br /><br />Original review<br />Five hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.<br /><br />I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.<br /><br />I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.<br /><br />The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.<br /><br />My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.<br /><br />It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.<br /><br />I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.<br /><br />I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole."
A2OSEYOHKI9OKR,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"One little booger down, God knows how many more left!","This is the first trap that has worked for us.....EVER!  Our neighbor's fianc&eacute; works for a critter control company in town. He brought two of these traps over and within two hours of setting them we caught our first mole!<br /><br />Our yard has been terrorized by these beasts and  we have tried many things: different traps, poison pellets.....even our Airedale Terrier. She's really good at digging huge holes in the yard....but not actually catching anything.<br /><br />As one reviewer wrote, ""You are looking for long straight runs. Long straight runs are like mole highways. The curvy short runs are hunting roads. The curvy runs are less traveled. Hunt the highways."" This is so true! Listen to his advice and you can't go wrong.<br /><br />UPDATE - 6-25-09 - Four moles in less than a month.  And that's only because we haven't been too diligent in resetting them."
A1HPGGEGZX3NH,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Death to the MOLES,The Victor Out of Sight mole trap is the bomb!!!  I have tried everything short of shooting at them with horrible results.  I heard about this trap from a professional critter killer.  I set the trap and checked the next day.  Bingo!!  Dead mole.  I reset the trap in another location...Bingo!!  Dead mole.  It's just that easy.  The jaws are heavy duty and would probably break your arm if it activated there.  I am recommending this trap to everyone I know.  Kill them all and save none for next year!!!
AZB5C6BNYAI4T,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Woo Hoo! Something finally works!!,"Let me start this by saying I'm a huge animal lover, but when it comes to moles, f*** them! I've hunted these bastards for years, trying everything, until I came across these traps. As other reviewers have said, they work great...as long as you DON'T follow the instructions. Please read the review marked ""most helpful"" explaining the right way to set them. I started setting them 3 days ago, and once I got the hang of it, I caught two in one day!  Bought three to corner them.  It's also nice because even though the product pic looks like it cuts the mole, it actually crushes it, so no mess.  They are hard to set. You need pretty good arm strength, but worth every second and penny.  Don't spend more either. I was tempted to buy more expensive ones, thinking, how could a $10 trap compare?  But no worries.  Just buy more to increase your odds.  I can't explain how excited I am right now.  I'm off now to save the rest of my yard.<br /><br />5/27/11 UPDATE:  Got 2 more in the last 24 hours, so I'm up to 4 moles killed by these traps.  Number 5 will be dead tomorrow.  I will have a new nickname soon: ""The Mole Hunter""<br /><br />6/29/11 UPDATE:  Now 7 moles dead in less than 2 months with these traps.  Enough said!"
A1X8ETXGPI7VYS,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Awesome Trap,"This trap really works, if you disregard the printed instructions that come with it. Caught two within a few days!!! Now I can finally begin repairing the damage these buggers did to my lawn. Read what Geoffrey Klos posted in his review and follow these instructions instead, then it's really easy to catch it (or them). Highly recommended item if you have a mole problem...<br />To find a good spot to set your traps, stomp everything down and wait a day. Watch where the earth is lifted up again, these are active tunnels. Try to find straight runs, these are called ""runways"". Anything else are feeding tunnels and they come through these only infrequently. A good indicator are actual mole-hills. This is where the deeper tunnels start (their living room, basically). The runways often extend from these mounds. Runways are also often found in parallel to obstructions, such as foundations, driveways or lawn edging. Those are also good places to set your traps.<br />Good luck hunting! :-)"
AS9F755Y7DVZ3,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor Out O' Site,"These traps work. I started out with two and recently bought 4 more when I bought a bigger house on 1.5acres. I've got 8 moles in two months. The trick is find the straight runs (highways) and to open up the run completely as wide as the trap is using a small garden trowel, set the trap down in the run and then pile all the dirt back over the trap. Last thing I do before walking away is flip the safety back onto fire using the tip of the trowel. If I haven't got one in 5days I move the trap. I learned how to set them from a local pro that uses these traps."
A2ZJYLAIQVJWBQ,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Out of sight trap,I bought this and in 10 days I had 4 moles.  It took a little time to get things right but when I did WOW!! It works great. Things had slowed down but I the yard is getting better. I just watch for the (highway)then set the trap. I havn't miss one yet.
A7Q6WD9Q6HXV,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Finally a way to get rid of these moles!!!!,"I bought two of these traps after trying chewing gum, moth balls, other mole traps, castor oil, battery operated mole chasing poles.  None of those worked very well but I got my first mole 3 days after installing one of these in my backyard. They are a little tricky to set-you should use your foot to help pry it open-but it works like a charm and the best part is that you have confirmed proof that you got one!!"
A115HCTCIXLP73,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole Trap - It Works!,"This mole trap does catch moles, although its a bit difficult to set.  Takes a lot of strength and I cannot do it so I have get my husband to re-set it when we need to do so.  It caught 2 moles in the front yard and we are seeing no new mounds in that area, at least!  Also, according to package directions, which we followed, one has to dig up a bit more of one's lawn to embed the device than the mole has already dug up.  Still, for the price and a bit of patience, it gets the job done."
AWFUR419LHJAF,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Success with the Victor 0631 trap,"I purchased 3 of the victor 0631 traps. They got to my house promptly.  There was a mole that troubled my lawn and flower beds for 3 months. I brushed aside conventional wisdom about mole behavior and the need to put traps only in frequently used main runs. I seeded the most recent activity with a total of 6 traps.  I carefully installed one of the new victor traps in a feeding run. Making sure the blades were free, and placing a mound of dirt in the center of the run to cause the mole to push through it and resulting in a trip of the trap. I poured fine dirt to close off light.  I also wore washed rubber gloves. I was also careful to set the trip on the very edge of the trip pan catch for hair trigger action.<br /><br />Next morning I came back and one of the purchased traps was sprung. The jaws of death closed on the neck of a huge mole. He was dead, the jaws of this trap are so powerful that they kill without fail. This was my first KILL with a victor trap.<br /><br />THEY WORK.  Just be careful with your fingers when you set these traps. Follow the basic steps outlined above and exercise patience, you will get them with this trap."
A7XP66PLAA5DC,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Impossible to assemble,"I don't know who could assemble this mole trap but it would take a strong hand and a persistent helper.<br />If we could put it together and we did catch a mole, I guess it would mean going through the process all over again.<br />We sent it back."
A24FYH1C8QT1XE,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Disappointed, but unbowed","I was fully intent on becoming a mole serial killer.  I wanted the very mention of my name to strike fear in generation after generation of the little turds.  But, to this point, the moles are having the last laugh.  The trap has failed to catch a single tunnel builder.<br /><br />The ""trap"" has sprung once in the weeks I've had it set. I could barely contain my excitement as I wrenched it from the tunnel, only to find that all it contained was a large clump of bermuda grass.<br /><br />My wife is belittling me for my purchase of this device.  I promised my young neighbor I'd bring her a mole, as she's never seen one.  Looking over the fence and repeatedly telling her, ""Not yet"" is getting embarrassing.<br /><br />It seems the moles are on to me.  Each time I set the trap they alter their route(s).  As soon as I move the trap, they return to their old tunnel(s).  It's becoming a game to both of us.  I WILL WIN THIS GAME.<br /><br />I ain't giving up.  I trusted the glowing reviews of this device that I read.  Yes, I have considered that the review was written by either the inventor of the trap...or by an employee of the trapmaker's company.  But I will persevere.  While my friends await the reportage of the first dead mole; while my neighbor awaits her first ever eyeballing a mole; and while my wife continues her laughing at my empty mole trophycase...I continue the battle.  I will not toss this ""trap"" into the pile of failed mole-stopping gear.<br /><br />I will report back when the first mole meets its demise."
A3EI25Q49P1JDN,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Very Effective with practice in setting,"This trap has been so effective that it has almost taken the challenge out of trapping moles in my yard.  I had tried other types of traps and was disappointed with the results. I've put my other experiences at the end if you are interested.<br /><br />As with any trap, it must be set in an active tunnel and it took a couple attempts to learn to set the Out O Sight.  However, once learned and active tunnels found, I have a 100% tripped trap/dead mole ratio.  As several others have said, following the directions sets the trap too deep.  On the other hand, the method described in other reviews here was too shallow to work for me.<br /><br />I have a recently re-graded yard with new topsoil trucked in so the soil is still fairly loose.  The top of most of the mole tunnels are about 3-4"" deep.  Pushing the tunnel down and setting the trap on top without digging down proved too shallow.<br /><br />The technique that has worked for me is similar to that on the box, but not quite as deep as described.  Carefully excavate a section of the tunnel as wide as the trap and as deep as the bottom of the tunnel without disrupting the structure of the bottom half of the tunnel ... the bottom half of the walls and the floor.  Then take a few clumps of the dirt (it has been very wet here since starting to trap) and put them in the tunnel between where the claws of the trap will go.  Don't pack it tight, just drop them in.  Set the trap with the claws slightly deeper than the bottom of the tunnel by pressing it in.  The trip pan should sit on the clumps you put in.  Put the remainder of the soil back around the tunnel opening you made and around the trap to block out the light.  Do your best not to disrupt the tunnel leading up to the trap's jaws and don't pack it too tighly.  You want the mole to be in the jaws before encountering blockage.<br /><br />I have been holding the trip pan down while pushing the trap to the desired depth so I don't accidentally set it off and then making sure the release side of the trip pan is not tight against the soil which would possibly prevent it from springing.<br /><br />Since starting in November, the count is 10 with 3 of them in the last week.  Most of the time I have my quarry within 12 hours of setting the trap .  The time it will take is directly dependent on finding an actively used tunnel.  I patrol my yard almost every day and get the trap in immediately after finding a new tunnel.<br /><br />I have docked the device one star because the jaw of one of the first two traps I bought inexplicably cracked.  Also because I think it could be easier to set, but practice makes perfect. (use caution)  Despite this, the trap has been so effective and much less expensive than the alternatives that I have purchased 3 additional traps to replace the broken one and the other traps I have purchased that were not effective.<br /><br /> Plunging spear type:  Anchoring seemed to be an issue as well as spring strength to reach the mole in the heavy clay soil here.  The trap would be tripped, but no mole under it.<br /> Trapline in-tunnel wire trap:  A device that is genius in its simplicity and would likely do well in dryer soil than I was trying to trap in.  My experience was the moles digging around the device.  Perhaps I just didn't master setting it.  I also didn't like having to dig up the trap to see if it was tripped.<br /> Poison pellets:  Not sure if the moles took them or not.  Worked too slowly to stop the damage, so a worthless approach in my mind."
A1JPKOCADX9EOS,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,The best answer I have found for moles,"Another mole hunter from St Louis here. I have tried everything: pellets, smoke bombs, different poisons, flooding the holes, a pretty useless trap sold in Lowes and Home Depot (I did get one mole last year with this but it's very weak and flimsy. I think I was lucky). A friend of mine told me she was fed up and was going to pay a professional to catch her moles. He caught 2 of them in a couple of weeks and she hasn't had a problem since. I asked her if she could figure out what kind of trap he used. Well, this is the one!<br /><br />Since I bought these traps a few months ago, I have caught 5 moles (that includes 1 for my neighbor). Despite having caught 4 moles in my front and back yards, there is still new  activity from time to time. I think they cover the whole neighborhood. I have some traps in my yard and a couple in my neighbor's across the street. I have purchased 6 traps (they are a great price and VERY sturdy) and I'm about to purchase 2 more to send to my in-laws.<br /><br />The way I have found these work for me is as follows:<br />1. Try to pick out a tunnel that looks like a common route or ""freeway."" For me, it's usually close to a path or driveway where they have hit the ""wall"" and work their way along it. Don't stomp all the raised tunnels down unless there are so many you need to find a place to start.<br />2. By keeping the tunnel open and just pushing down the dirt in the area you intend to place the trap, the next time the mole comes by he will just start digging his way right into the trap. I like to keep the soil pretty loose where the trap is going to be placed so when the ground gets hard and baked, the trap will still be able to spring shut quickly. Just make sure the holes on both sides of the trap are covered. The dirt in the compressed area is usually about an inch or less below the rest of the ground.<br />3. Remember to use the safety catch when placing the trap in the ground. You want to make sure the flat base of the trap, (the part the mole will push up when he tunnels to trigger the trap) is well set in the ground and the four spikes in the ground are on either sides of the tunnel. It may be a little difficult to set the trap but it's not THAT hard to do. Come on!<br />4. Be patient. The first time I set a trap I had a mole in less than twelve hours. The last one I caught was in a trap in my garden which I had set 3 weeks earlier. Of course if you see new activity in a different area, you may want to move the trap. Trial and error.<br /><br />****Somebody else claimed these traps are hard to set. Yes, the springs on them are very strong and it takes a little elbow grease. The trap does come with tools to help you set the trap. If it wasn't this strong I may as well use the useless trap from Lowes."
A2JLPPU80ZCHFO,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It really  works!,"I TRIED THE TYPE OF TRAPS THAT STABBED SPIKES INTO THE GROUND, AND HAD NO SUCCESS.  THE VICTOR TAKES A LITTLE PRACTICE, BUT IT REALLY GETS THE MOLES. I'VE CAUGHT THREE MOLES IN THE LAST MONTH, AND YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THE MAIN TUNNEL AND SET THE TRAP WITH A LUMP OF PACKED DIRT JUST BELOW THE TRIGGER PAN.  I TRIED FOUR TIMES AND GOT THREE MOLES, AND I STILL AM FINDING BURROWS IN PARTS OF MY LOT THAT IS WOODED AND BRUSHY.  THEY EAT MOSTLY NIGHT-CRAWLERS AND THE BEST TIME TO FIND THEM IS THE DAY AFTERR A GOOD RAIN.<br /><br />I BOUGHT THREE TRAPS AT AMAZON FOR FAR LESS THAN IN THE LOCAL HARDWARE STORES."
A2S6T0AUW40S28,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Mole Terminator!!!!!!,"This is an awesome trap for mole removal!<br /><br />I have killed 13 moles with one trap in a four month period!<br />This trap has only missed twice, and I believe it was because I set it too deep.<br /><br />I had trouble just yesterday killing one in my front yard so I tried the Tom Cat poison worm bait and this morning bingo! dead mole next to my big pine tree.<br /><br />I would recommend using both products simultaneously for total mole eradication."
ANOC3HMUE0JSP,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Don't Follow the Directions,I received this trap on Friday and Saturday that $#@%^* Mole is dead. I followed the advice of other reviewers and I had no problem on locating the trap. The only problem I had is setting it up. The directions are less than better describing the arming process. It took me awhile to figure out how to cock it and where the trigger was to be when doing so. Be ready to use some muscle when arming it and watch you fingers. I'm completely satisfied with this product. Again read the other reviews on the location procedures they used and you'll have no problems.  Good Luck!!!
ACI5MU4FJ40P9,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Moles!,First 24 hours and we caught our first mole and only set 1 of our traps! Good news. ;)
A2WSATQ1L3LXIO,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Difficult to set and use,"This trap does the job, but nearly as well as others I have.  THe trap is difficult to set and requires the use of special tools that come with the trap, but are not part of it.  Even with the tools this trap is a pain to set compared to others. Once you get is set and placed on an active run it does the job.  Another issue I have with this trap is that it's design and color make it difficult to see from a disance and impossible to tell if it is sprung.  You have to remeber where you put it and check it periodically.  I recommend poking the tools into the ground next to the trap so you will know where they are."
A9Q7CIXDP9XUT,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Great Trap,This is a great mole trap. I set it up last week on a mole trail and got him on the first try.
A3K21F8PZJCSC1,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,OUT OF SIGHT MOLE TRAP,The Out of Site Mole Trap does exactly what it is designed to do. We set one out and the very next day we got a mole. They are definitely worth the money they cost.
A1OMJWOIY2K1VU,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,So far so good..,"I commenced Molicide 2010 this week. After reading all the reviews here and on Northern's website last month, I was very excited to try this trap.  I planted my first trap today at 11:00 a.m. and it cleanly killed a mole by 12:30 p.m.!  After only 1.5 hours, I shouldn't have even been checking the traps... but there one was!!  No one believed me until they saw the proof.  There was no blood, but the mole was dead as a door nail.<br /><br />We run a 35 acre condo complex and have had VERY little luck with spear traps and poison worms.  I'm just hoping this mole wasn't beginner's luck!  We have at least 22 different mole activity areas and I swear some of the areas are too much for one mole.  So we bought 5 of these traps for starters and will get 5 more if the moles start piling up.  I have yet to try the method near mound activity, we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />Just follow the reviewer instructions and be diligent about making sure runs are fresh.  Good luck!"
A3AR51T7RWUS0W,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It Worked!,"I've tried the solar beeping to scare the moles away, I tried a harpoon type trap for months, and I've tried capturing them live with no results for about 1 year.  I searched internet on traps and noticed some professional trappers used this kind of trap.<br /> My first attempt got no results but on my second attempt my trapped got sprung but I thought it was due to a heavy rain since the trigger is very sensitive and ignored it, but when I went to move it there was dead mole. It only took about a week. I got another one a week later. I did follow other reviews by not burying it like instructions say but to place it over a stamped down tunnel. I also used a lid from a tuna can under the tripping arm to increase the sensitivity. If want to get the moles use this."
AWBOMCQEW8IRV,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It Works and It Works Fast!,"Follow the directions of others on this site by placing the trap on the surface of the ground and you will trap moles.  2 moles in the first week.  Make sure the track is active.  I found it best by pressing the trip lever down with my finger to make sure it was flush with the ground (be sure to place the safety lever in position while setting the trap).  The traps works as advertised.  Very strong spring action so keep pets and hands out of the way of a set trap.  I placed small garden buckets over the traps to help avoid pet interaction.<br /><br />Update: 10/7/10 -- I've trapped 4 moles with this trap.  It continues to work very well.  Use at first sign of mole activity and you can be sure run is active.  I've trapped moles within an hour of setting the trap.  The only sure way to eliminate moles from your yard is to kill them with this trap.<br /><br />Update 9/28/11 -- ""Mole season"" again.  Saw a new track this afternoon; set the trap and in 45 minutes dead mole!  This is the only mole control I've used that works!  You're wasting your money on the gadgets -- this continues to work year after year!"
A2O8CJX1YU3B4A,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor Mole Traps - Out of Sight,"These are much more difficult to set and move than the other Victor spear-type models.  When ""hunting"" moles, you must move the traps frequently and this Out of Sight version is cumbersome."
A22WQZAKL80RG7,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Finally, caught a mole!","I've had a problem with moles for just a few months, but they have done quite a bit of damage to my yard in that short time.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try the Out of Sight trap.  It took me a few weeks but I finally caught one mole (I'm sure there's more out there).<br /><br />I tried following the directions on the box as well as the directions in the reviews here.  I didn't have much success with just cutting slits for the blades and leaving the trap at ground level.  I eventually dug up a small area and I noticed that the hole runs were actually a little deeper than the blades would go if left on top of the grass. The cool weather may have something to do with the moles digging deeper; or I simply chose a bad spot. However, it was the most active area so seemed to be a logical choice to set the trap.<br /><br />So, I basically followed the included instructions and finally caught my first mole.  As others have said, you may need to finish off the little diggers yourself so just be prepared for that...I guess a shovel is the best tool for the job.  The traps do require a bit of strength to set and you need to be careful with them as the spring is very strong. At first glance it looks like some kind of medieval torture device.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is that often times moles are simply a symptom of other problems - mostly likely lawn grubs. I'm certainly not an expert, but it sounds like moles feed largely on these grubs. So getting rid of the grubs may prevent future moles...that's next on my to do list."
AQM50WLDP1SOR,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,It is hard to set,"I found it very hard to set and to keep set.  The springs are quite strong an hard to hold with one hand and the trigger doesn't stay shut very well.  I have allways used the loop type traps such as the Nash ""Choker Loop"" mole trap that were easier and safer to use.  However, these are very well made and cost alot less than the loop types."
A7FR5RLMOI41A,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor 0631 works well.  Mole trapping is just tedious,"This trap works well.  Find advise from internet searches for setting traps.  The hard part is knowing where to put the trap.  I have caught 3 moles but I have to keep moving the traps.  Also, there is a video on some web site that shows how to set this Victor 0631 trap.  Ridding your yard is a multiyear job... or maybe never ending job but every time one of my traps was tripped it crushed the mole and without blood showing."
A335MP58UIBNW,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Victor 0631 Mole Trap Fantastic,"This trap is far superior to the Victor ""harpoon"" version. The spring is extremely strong and will close on any dirt or sod. Thanks to a previous review, you need to ignore the directions on the box. Flatten a small area of the mole run the width of the trap and use a spade or garden shovel to make a slit to allow each jaw of the trap to fit easily in the ground. Don't forget to use the safety hook while placing the trap and to remove after the trigger is set. I had the mole in two days and it did not evade this trap."
A37KGRZIYXUF0C,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,This works!,"I tried repellents before trying this product. The repellent was of no use. This trap, though took some time to setup, worked on the very first day! Just find the active tunnel and set this up.

A3JEA32ACRX4DU,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,"Finally, the solution to my mole problem.","I have a little less than half an acre of yard, which is right against a wooded green space. Moles have been a problem for us since we moved in three years ago. Poison pellets, poison worms, spike trap, smoke bombs, scoot mole...All of these I've tried and, if they worked, it sure wasn't noticeable to me. At my wit's end, I called a professional service two months ago to control the mole problem. For $180, for one month of service, they placed 6 of these very same traps. The problem is, they came every week to check on the traps. So, one month later and one mole later (an additional $35 for removal of the dead mole), they yanked the traps. Well, one dead mole was better than my previous record of zero and I couldn't possibly justify spending another $180 + $35 for each dead mole for this service, so I ordered four of my own.<br /><br />The day I received them, one month ago, I placed all of them out along runs that, of course, magically popped up when the service had terminated. That very evening, while out on the patio, we heard a snap. The trap I had placed on the main run coming from the woods had caught one heading in the direction of my yard. The next day I removed the traps and stamped down all the runs. Around a week later, I spotted more runs so I placed the traps again. The next morning, I had another one. I waited a day or so, pulled the traps and stamped down the runs. The next time I saw runs was this past weekend. I placed all the traps again around 3pm. About 2 hours later (no, I'm not exaggerating), I had another mole. I pulled that trap, but left the others behind. The next morning another trap was full. For $53.72 I have trapped 4 moles and have been able to keep the moles from devastating my yard.<br /><br />To say I am completely satisfied with this product would be an understatement. In my opinion, this is the best solution out there to keep moles from destroying your yard. The advice I have regarding these traps is to make sure to buy enough traps to cover all the runs and increase your odds of trapping a mole. Additionally, be sure to be vigilant for the runs. At first sign, deploy your traps as you will likely increase the odds of trapping a mole in a run that was just made versus a run that is days old. Lastly, to deploy your traps successfully: 1)Find a relatively straight run (not those windy, loopy runs) 2)Stamp down just over a trap-width of the run with your foot 3)Set the trap and push it into the ground straddling the stamped-down run until the catch touches the ground 4)Enjoy the satisfaction of knowing, after you pull out your first sprung trap and the bane of your existence is dangling from the claws of the trap, that you just saved yourself years of frustration (and money!) by simply buying a few of these traps. Good luck!"

A3VWFHM5N3W5IL,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Best Trap Available,"I have trapped almost 100 moles with my fleet of 12 traps (now down to about 8 traps along with 2 new lawn mower blades). The first year I trapped around 30 moles and the population has been dropping every year for the last six years...only two so far this year. I followed the instructions for setting the trap and haven't had a problem - maybe they have changed the instructions in the last 6 years??? The nice thing about these traps is you can set them deep or shallow depending on the depth of the moles trail. I even managed to trap two moles (head to head) in one trap a few years ago - I'm sure the odds of this happening are similar to winning lottery. They are a very powerful trap, so make sure you caution your children. I borrowed one of my traps to a friend of mine and his kid pulled it out of the ground, brought it to him, and asked what it was. The trap was set, but fortunately, never went off in his hand."
A2P1HK323PBQZ2,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Best mole trap but needed a little tweaking,"From my reserch, this is the best mole trap out there.  It does work for me but took lots of trial and error to figure out how to set it correctly.  I bought two, one worked perfectly, but one had too much powder coat on the trigger pan to release properly.  Don't be afraid to use pliers on it to adjust the release/ trigger pan lip to set the release force.  And make sure the legs pass each other when released, one leg was slightly bent striking the other on one. What I found works best for Pacific NW moles was to dig the trap hole just barely large enough for the trap.  No loose dirt on ends of trap.  Clear the mole tunnel of all loose dirt with a spoon and pack the bottom solid so he doesn't dig around in the soft dirt. I used sod to cover the trap with NO dirt back fill in the hole like the instructions say. Once I found a main tunnel to set it in, its deadly!"

I am also near the St. Louis area and my back yard had been DESTROYED over a period of 3 months.<br /><br />I finally got this trap in the mail, followed your advice of putting it on top of the earth over a straight run, and caught him the first night!<br /><br />I thought it was the only one until 10 days later another run showed up so I have just placed the trap over it.  Wish me luck.<br /><br />Thanks again and if you follow ABK and Geoffrey's advice below, you'll get that varmint!"
A12DBNZP5IAJHD,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Bought 4,"As others stated, if used correctly in a good location, you will get more moles with this than any other trap I have seen.  It is tough and effective.  Be very careful setting it, the spring is very strong.  Also, after setting, I like to sit a coffee can over the top of it so dogs and cats do not mess with it.  After you figure out how to use it, it is very effective.  The pros use this trap for a couple reasons:<br />1) Effectiveness<br />2) Cost of trap<br />3) Durability<br /><br />We trap all kinds of animals using a variety of traps and this mole trap is one of my favorites."
A24GR1MZXO4MOM,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Great Mole Trap,A very well built mole trap that works great when set correctly.  The safety latch is a nice feature that prevents accidental tripping while setting the trap. I don't follow the box instructions but rather set the traps on the surface.  This works well with a lot less effort than trying to bury them.  I've found that a person needs to be very patient.  The mole may not use the tunnel for several days.  In fact I've caught some after five or six days.  Picking the best tunnel is the hardest part of trapping moles so spent your time there rather than moving traps around every two days.

A1ZA6Z8V6IBVLV,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,I feel strongly BOTH ways!,"Thanks to Mr. Klos and a lot of other people who have added to this forum, I am now the proud owner of 5 of these mole traps with no more moles to trap (for now).  Mr. Klos' method probably would work best if I had not spent the summer smashing down the mole runs. They just dug deeper tunnels. Common sense and a little exploration told me the Klos method would put the squeezers ABOVE the tunnel.  But, other reviews told that, once they figured out that the poor instructions on the package were for deeper tunnels, they were successful. All my tunnels were too deep to use the Klos method.<br /><br />So, I dug up each main run and cleaned out each end of the tunnel to find the common middle ground.  I built a hard mound in the center of the open space.  I loaded the trap and put the safety on.  I placed the trap directly on top of the mound, with the spring barely touching the mound.  It was good I kept the safety on until I buried the trap because a couple times I put it so far down the spring sprung.<br /><br />So, which way is best?  The method that puts the bottom of the trap at the bottom of the run. Don't smash the tunnels down; then, the trap can be placed on the top of the ground merely by inserting two slits in a main run.  I followed the seller's instructions and it worked for deeper runs. Next year, the runs will be trapped without being stomped down first.  Happy hunting."

So far I've caught two - put the trap in the ground and dead mole within 24 hours!<br /><br />Like others have said, don't follow the instructions.

Push the trap down until the trip lever touches the ground and you're all set.<br /><br />This thing is the best.  Don't bother with poisons, noise makers, etc...just get this."

When the mole decided to move into my garden, it was the last straw. I got this trap along with the more expensive Wire Tek 1001. Set the Wire Tek out in hopes that I could just use one trap and return this one. But after a day, I hadn't caught it yet so I decided to deploy both. Moved the Wire Tek to a new location and put the Victor in it's place. I followed the instructions that came with it and within 12 hours, the Victor had a dead mole in its jaws. Easy to use, effective, and permanent solution for moles!"

I'm sure this works great in loamy lawns but I have plants, not grass, and live in suburban California, which means lots of clay! It is extremely difficult to find mole runs except in winter when the rain softens the clay. For my particular situation, i've found the Cinch mole traps to be extremely effective - they worked in a week. I did modify my method to try to match what other reviewers and youtube videos show, but if you don't have a nice soft lawn, there are better tools to catch moles with."

I put them on what I thought were active trails/tunnels and after a day had no movement so I moved them again.<br /><br />Next day - BOOM! Got on and it pinched it's back, so it was still living to I relocated it to a field a few miles away. Put the trap in the SAME spot and next day BOOM! go another one - this one not so lucky...<br /><br />They work great - make sure just like the reviews state to cut two slits to fix the ""claws"" and to step down the ground even - remove the safety and you are good to go."
A3S7WFS2S3AL6Q,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Set it the way others say and it works great.,"I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear."
A1B3NVO946I99F,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caught the mole within 12 hours!,"I don't have lawn so I thought I could live with moles peacefully, as long as they don't destroy my landscaping. After two years those moles start popping up anywhere they want and dirt piles here and there. They are out of control. I have tried many baits and that ultra-sound thing, none of them work! I can't live with the moles anymore because my landscaping is being turned up-side down by them.<br /><br />I first bought one trap, after two weeks nothing happened. Then I bought another three. With all of these, I can make a trap field. I planted them last evening and this morning I went to check. Wahoo! One trap was triggered! I haven't looked at that it caught, but I am so sure there is a mole caught. I am so happy to write this review right after I saw the triggered trap.<br /><br />I think the most important thing is that, since mole is hard to track, you should use several traps together. Also on YouTube, there is a very nice video shows you how to set this trap up - build a dirt bridge, use some fresh tree leaves, etc. Carefully designing the trap field that was also contribute to the success.<br /><br />>>> I went to dig the mole out, this is my first experience on how a mole look like. It is very....YUCK!"
A3RKI6AF0MIQ4S,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Great Product,Bought 3 of these mole traps after a lot a research and reviews from others about this product.  Follow the suggestions of other users and caught a mole within an hour of setting the trap.  Have had the traps for about one month now and have caught 11 moles.  I can't believe the product works so well.  Would suggest you give them a try if you have a mole problem like I do.

They are a little hard to set but that what it takes to hold moles. Mole are hard to kill with some traps. No traps work well in tree roots. This Victor 0631 is the one to use.

The first location did not get anything but the second one caught my first mole after being set for 3 days.  I definitely recommend this style over the kind with the spikes that sit up above the ground.  The name is a little deceiving as the trap is not completely out of sight but it's fairly low profile and the part that could do the most damage to little hands and feet is already underground when it is set, so I feel that the kids are in very little danger playing in the yard nearby.<br /><br />The toughest part is identifying active runs.  The thicker the grass, the harder it is to identify where the runs are.<br /><br />The hunt continues..."

I didnt want to kill the little guy, but he was really tearing up the lawn and he wasn't moving out.<br /><br />Probably the major con with this trap is it does take a lot of strength to open.

Getting rid of their food source or trying to chase them away through other ways just will NOT work. You have to kill them! I bought a new home with 5 acres to mow. There were so many mounds and tunnels it looked like I had over a hundred moles in there. You literally could not step anywhere without stepping on a tunnel. I tried everything while the simplest and cheapest way were these traps. Don't make the same mistake I did trying to kill grubs and using spore etc, etc,---just get these traps and use em and your done. I put 4 of these traps on 5 acres and in three weeks I got 5 moles and that was all I had! Moles can tunnel up to 80 feet in one day. that is why it looks like there must be hundreds of moles.

A1LW5RIRK9YFCN,B00004RAMY,Pest Control,Caution - Safety loop maybe faulty,"I received the traps that I ordered and was glad that I had watched several videos on setting them as there is absolutely nothing in the box that really helps figure out how to set the trap effectively.  I am fairly literate when it comes to reading instructions and therefore, I consider the enclosed instructions only fair.  You can figure it out but that is exactly what you have to do is there is nothing in the illustrations that is all that helpful.<br /><br />So far I have not been successful in actually trapping a mole but still trying.  However, I am writing this review to caution the reader of something that could have been disastrous to me from using this device.  As I was checking one of the traps, I decided to move it so I set the safety loop over the bar as it is designed to be done.  AS I moved the trap, and I am still not sure what happened, the device sprung and instead of the safety catch stopping the action, it actually came off with great velocity hitting me in the forehead about 2 inches from my eye.  The wound is small but none the less, hurt like crazy and bled profusely.  I hate to think of it hitting me in the eye or mouth!  As I said, I don't know really what happened but still have not found the safety catch - maybe a mole will return it!  Be careful and I suggest wearing safety glasses when setting."

They have a bit of a gritty texture as compared to regular brownies, and they are SUPER chocolatey. It is the most intense chocolate flavor I've ever had in a brownie. But I like that kind of thing, so I love 'em! Plus, they don't have a ton of fat and they have fewer calories than non-GF brownies, and because they are so chocolatey, they satisfy me quicker than what I remember with non-GF brownies. The ingredients are all organic too, which is nice.<br /><br />Highly recommended. :)"
A3NLH2Y9E59J93,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,good!!! taste,"This brownie mix is great, we have tasted so many brands and so far Pamela's products (brownie mix, bread mix, pancake mix, and chocolate chip cookies) are the best, I really recommend this items!!"
A1REUVV0JG6S1F,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Good and easy brownie mix,"I usually use two packages of the mix and bake the mix in a 9 X 13 cake pan.  It is easy to mix up and can be frozen for eating later on.  Of course, they must be refrigerated but travel well for on-the-road meals.  I highly recommend this mix to the chocaholics out there!"
A3JI2PY1C37GN4,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,AWESOME BROWNIE MIX!!!!!!!!!,"This is my absolute favorite gluten free baking mix. You ""must"" add in the suggested ""extras"" to make the best brownies: 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c chocolate chips or chunks. Sometimes takes longer to bake also, so dont overbake, but worth the time/wait! Those who can eat gluten fight over these brownies with me! :-)"
A10TN1JAVPHKWR,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Excellent WF/GF brownie mix!,"We've eaten Pamela's Brownie mix for years.  My kids actually prefer it now to wheat brownies. And now at Amazon, buying by the case AND via autoship, its the best price I've ever found!"
A3UHTZP614FLMF,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Not quite as advertised,"The ingredients shown on Pamela's website did not show any corn in the mix.  The package lists corn derivatives in the mix.  My grandson is allergic to corn, so this is a problem."
A3TU7BHW9GHSPR,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Brownie mix -- Nothing to write home about,"I tried Pamela's Brownie Mix on the recommendation of a relative with celiac, about a year after I was diagnosed.  I was pretty disappointed; although moist with a very brownie-like texture, there is an aftertaste I didn't like that I notice in many GF baking mixes.  Also I agree with the comment about them tasting carob-y instead of chocolatey.  My non-GF family & friends said they were ""weird"" and ""different"".  Not terrible, but after I tasted one, I did not want another.  I'm sticking with the flourless brownie recipe I've been using; at least my family likes them."
A2VA1CSQ74IKXP,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,"not ""chocolatey"" enough for me","Not bad but I found it has more of a ""carob"" flavor than the rich chocolate taste of the Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie mix.  I am a chocolate-lover and this product was a disappointment to my taste buds.  I tried it because I love Pamela's baking mix.  I went back to the Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - far superior taste and texture."
A36Z5NGBSMSPDX,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,THE best brownies...,"If these brownies are gluten free, than I shall forever eat gluten free!  They are better than brownies containing gluten.  I have made them for parties and everyone always raves over them.  I even have had some family members act concerned that I would let my kids eat these brownies since they are suppose to eat only gf foods...little did they know the brownies are gf!  My skeptical friends and relatives who love to make fun of my different recipes (they don't really get it) cannot believe these brownies are gluten free.  THE best - the simplest terms in which to describe them!"
A3M0NVYTW4NUX6,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Delicious and very tasty!,This is one of the best gluten-free brownies that are just as good as or even better than the brownies that are made from wheat. Excellent treat for people who cannot tolerance gluten. A must buy for the gluten sensitive person
A6Z35QL8IZG1J,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,great product!,I bought several baking goods from Pamela's and all of them are really good!! It shows that healthy doesn't have to taste bad.
A3BSPXD2A2UQ2T,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Suprisingly GOOD,"I initially purchased a package of this brownie mix from Walmart; it was on clearance. For years, I had no idea why I was always sick. One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently, I did not eat it. I was not sad, but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway, I made these brownies tonight. Since I like cake-like brownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor), I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 1/4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans, so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good brownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies. My brownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose-free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events. It won't even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until AFTER they've said how good they are. (smile)"
A2W6NRPTHUBS4L,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Wow!,"I've had some gluten free foods that were terrible, but this is not one of them! These are amazing. My 8 y/o daughter has recently been put on a gluten free diet by her doctor for gluten intolerance (testing for Celiac also) and she was upset that she couldn't have ""anything worth eating"" anymore. I made her these brownies, and she said they were better than my recipe (which was a wheat based brownie)! Along with food intolerances she has high-functioning autism so she is very picky about textures, gritty food bothers her. I noticed a tiny texture difference from the wheat brownies but she gobbled them up anyway, they were THAT good. I made the ""original"" style, and it came out moist, soft, and just gooey enough but not undercooked. I like them better than wheat brownies, because you can cut these while they're still somewhat hot and they don't crumble! Getting them out of the pan hot is a trick but I only broke one brownie doing it. Even my husband, who can have all the gluten he likes, loved them."
A2CVJHRYDR2APU,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Best gluten-free anything!,"These brownies are a hit every time I take them to an event.  Everyone is always surprised that they are gluten-free. With a bit of gooey, chocolate icing, they're extremely decadent!"
AG8K92N37MT27,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Yummy Yummy Yummy,"Okay, when you try to go gluten or wheat free there are many things that you miss.  A nice fresh loaf of bread happens to be number one, but a close second is a wonderful pan of moist brownies.  The sad thing is that many gluten-free mixes end up with products that are coarse and dry...and, believe me, I've tried many.<br /><br />This one, however, is fabulous.  You'd never know it was gluten free.  In fact, if you make it for people who aren't going gluten free, they'll never know.  But why do that?  They can have their regular old brownies and you can have these...all for yourself.<br /><br />Easy to make.  Moist.  Nice texture.  They don't even need frosting.  Just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top if you like (if you sprinkle it through a doily it will make a pattern for fancy events).  I've also added nuts to this mix, such as almonds, walnuts, and even brazil nuts.<br /><br />Simply heaven."
A3J3T04O95XU4Y,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Amazing brownies,Superb! These are amazingly good. I'd eat them even if I could eat regular wheat flour based brownies. The egg free option is superb too which is also important to me.
AAFIARQ0LLY96,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Love this!,"Pamela's chocolate brownie mix is my favorite GF brownies to date. Very chocolatey with chunks of chocolate throughout. They are easy to mix, and a fast treat."
A2NV6EVUDPV0OP,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,How many delicious versions can you make from one brownie mix?,"Several decadent ones. And all the recipes are on each bag. Rave reviews from all my non-celiac friends. Excellent case price from Amazon versus any store (Whole Foods/Sprouts/Market Street/Central Market) where I can purchase in North Central Texas. An also outstanding alternative (if you want less decadent, more cake like, but also like the ""real thing"") is the Namaste Chocolate or Namaste Blonde Brownie mixes, both available by the case at a great price from Amazon. Everything Pamela's and everything Namaste I have tried have been excellent, this coming from someone who used to bake from scratch."
AX56NP6TLYN56,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Excellent flavor and good price,"I order these on a yearly basis for my gluten-intolerant girlfriend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />She loves these, which can be tough to do because she still remembers her pre-gluten-free days<br />They are easy to make (although she has me make them most of the time because I never over mix them, her's always have a cake consistency)<br />Well priced on Amazon, unlike in most stores<br /><br />The girlfriend is so impressed with Pamela's products, she has subscribed to the monthly newsletter and received countless recipes we love (e.g., gluten-free crepes)."
A2HDH7ROXCW6XJ,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,I love these!,I bought these in our supermarket on a whim one day.  I love them.  I have had digestive issues since childhood.  These taste great.  They dont make me feel sick.  I can have my cookie fix without feeling compelled to eat all of them.  My supermarket stopped carrying them so I bought the six pack.  I make them about once a month so the mixes will be used long before they expire.
A3ESQAU2PEKN8Z,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Fabulous!,"Note, the back of the package gives you options as to what you can add to the mix.  There is a cake-like optin, fudgy, non-oil, etc...  I used the ""fudgy"" recipe and it was FABULOUS!  They had a wonderful flavor.  I got them on a whim, suspecting one of my children may have a problem with gluten.  Even if he tests ok, I will buy these again, I actually prefer in some ways to the Duncan Hines brand I normally use.  My son has eaten them up!  We do not notice any aftertaste (which has been mentioned in other reviews).  Maybe they used a different recipe than fudgy?  I actually did notice the chocolate had a very rich taste, like they used a high quality coco powder."
A1O9BEDVTRI5JI,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,"Pricey, but yummy","While this mix is pretty pricey to end up with a small pan of brownies, they do have a great taste!  I love that they have alternative recipes on the package.  We have egg allergies, so I use the egg-free recipe.  I have to cook it for significantly longer than the recipe states, (10+ mins.), and still the brownies are pretty gooey and don't hold together.  OK to eat at home, but not good enough to take anywhere.  Again, they taste great, especially for a chocolate and sweets deprived pregnant woman :)"
A2YIQM399JDX89,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Delicious in all ways!,"Pamela's brownie mix does everything I want it to do.  Pamela""s prcoducts now replace all my previous baking products and even my grandchildren love them.  Great consistency and value."
AWM7Z8HGJMLRD,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,There's only one problem.....,"And that is the weight I will gain from eating too many of these scrumptious brownies!  I used the fudgiest brownie recipe with just oil and water, followed the directions to bake them for 18 minutes and got moist, chocolatey delicious brownies.  This is my first Pamela's product...next I'm going to try the corn bread!"
A2IY5HGKM1TZS0,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,"Birthday Cake Savior for GFCF + Egg, peanut and tree nut free household!","With a birthday fast approaching I was searching everywhere for a decent GFCF and egg, peanut and tree nut free cake recipe or mix.  I've tried several different recipes from several different cookbooks and websites in the past, but never felt compelled to recreate those disappointing cake moments.  I checked out Pamela's website and found an egg and dairy free cake recipe using the brownie mix.  I'd seen Pamela's products at my local grocery store, but stayed away because of the steep price ($7 for a single bag of the brownie mix!).  Then I found the product on Amazon and saw the subscribe and save price and the positive reviews, and that made me decide to take the plunge.<br /><br />I tried out the egg and dairy free recipe and not only did all the kids enjoy it, but so did the adults, some even had seconds.  The cake does taste and almost feels like brownie, but it tastes good and the texture is not off-putting.  After 2 years of disappointing birthday cake for my 3 kids, I've finally found a tasty and economical solution.  Thanks Pamela's Products!"
A13IOA1ZXEFTIX,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,It's delicious. Inbetween cake and bread,"I love this gluten free bread. Very easy to make....<br />a quick tip. After mixing and putting in bread pan, leave it<br />in a 200 degree oven for an hour and then bake it for another hour at 350. It gets a crispy crust but stays soft and firm on the inside. Try sprinkling a little raw sugar on the top before putting in oven. The only problem with this bread is that I overeat it."
A1MA6Q9FTFC9X,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,truly multipurpose,This product is great for not only brownies but also cake. I used the recipe on the side for decadent cake and everyone loved it. People didn't know it was gluten/casein free at all. Was flavorful and moist. I ran out of vanilla almond milk so I used chocolate almond milk. It made it more chocolatey.<br />For a gluten/casein free chocoholic it was a wonderful treat.
A133Z8M914CF7K,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,LOVE from a brownie snob,"Truly, I adore these brownies.  I am always reluctant to use mixes for anything but an extra crazy schedule forced me to grab this at the store, and boy howdy am I glad!  I made the butter version and added an extra Tablespoon of oil for extra moisture.  You know those flourless chocolate cakes that are so yummy?  That's what these remind me of.  I will be buying this again and again, and was so impressed that now I'm embarking on other Pamela products."
A3UA1LWHAWFIOY,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Wonderful for children who are gluten free and casein free,"My son has autism and is on the GFCF diet.  He loves this mix made into cookies.  I remove the chocolate chunks ( trying to keep them as low in sugar as possible)  and I add 8 tspns benefiber and 1/4 cup baby rice cereal to boost the nutrition.  Then I add 1/4 cup flax oil and 1/4 cup olive oil and bake on a pizza stone - they never burn on the pizza stone - might burn if cooked on conventional bakeware.  My son love these and he is a very very picky eater.  The brownies that this mix makes are fabulous, too.  Great for birthday parties."
A3BMXVPSW75SJF,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Wow - great!,"My 3-yr old daughter just got diagnosed with Celiac's. We're experimenting now finding the right products to substitute what we like that taste the best. This is the best brownie mix! I like it better than Bob's Red Mill brownie mix (which I thought was good too, but a bit moist). It tastes just like ""regular"" brownie mix. No complaints, everyone loves it, and my daughter doesn't have a tummy ache. Perfect!"
A1NTPNDLH3BLGE,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Simply the Best!,"Pamela's products can't be beat. I've tried other gluten-free products and none have been as good.<br />Not only the brownies, but all of the products from this company have<br />proven to be flavorful."
A1WM6NXOC944X2,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Perfect for those who need to go wheat-free,"I cannot say enough about Pamela's brands, especially the Brownie Mix.  They are just as good, if not better, than many conventional mixes out there.  And Pamela's gives many variations to the recipes on their packaging - although I highly recommend the ""Fudgiest Brownies"".  I bought a case for my sister who also went wheat-free and she agrees.  If you've found out you must have a wheat-free diet and feel that loss, try these products!"
AZZH3GGYQSBUC,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,"easy, tasty brownie mix","This is good stuff, of which I have consumed an absurd amount. I keep some of these brownies in the freezer at all times, for serving guests, or for having a little something sweet myself when I come home from an event where everyone but me (all the non-celiacs) have been snarfing down the cake or cookies and I have had . . . coffee.<br /><br />The first time I used this mix, I made the butter recipe, because I had always cooked with butter and was afraid it wouldn't taste good without butter. But the next time, I was in a hurry and didn't want to bother melting butter, so I made the oil version with canola oil, and it tasted just as good. And it's better for you. So that's what I make. I usually add half a cup of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. The flavor of the dough has a subtle richness that I think comes from being sweetened mostly with mollasses and honey. As with all brownies, don't over cook.<br /><br />I often make this to take to potlucks or other events that require ""something to share,"" because it's easy and quick and everyone who likes chocolate likes these brownies. They are very moist and rich; I cut them into very small squares. Unfortunately, they taste great right out of the freezer; otherwise they would last longer and I would weigh less."
A1S744L1J7CEP5,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,L-O-V-E this product!,"Another home-run from the people at Pamela's Bakery!  My family loves this brownie mix.  I make these brownies at least once a week.  I've made them for dessert and no one guesses that they're gluten-free.  We make the ""fudgy"" version and it really is just too good for words.  Nice chocolate chunks, also!<br />Another great value with Amazon's ""subscribe & save"".  This product is approaching $5 per bag at the foodstore.  Now, we can have brownies as much as we want!  Y-U-M!!!!"
A29MD4HHM3DARA,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Better than any brownies I've ever had,"And I LOVE brownies. I got this gluten-free mix so my husband could eat them, and I couldn't believe it when I tried them. SOOO good, just how a brownie should be. Chewy, fudgey, with chunks of chocolate, yum! Best brownies ever, gluten-free or not."
A3066UVUWXQOZX,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,FANTASTIC BROWNIE MIX!!,"My son was just diagnosed with allergies to several different grains.  I've been trying all kinds of products to pack in his lunches because of it.  I decided to try Pamela's wheat free, gluten free chocolate brownie mix.  He LOVED it.  He almost ate the whole pan in one day!  My husband, is SUPER picky about ""health"" foods and though the texture is somewhat different than white, bleached, enriched, yucchhh flour, he and my boy were fighting over the last pieces.  It is a little crumblier, but we all liked it.  Thank you Pamela's.  It's nice to find some alternatives out there;  the fact that they are healthier is just an added PLUS!!"
A1Q1NEDF3FV0MD,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,great as cookies,"This brownie mix doesn't bake at 7000 feet altitude, but it works super well as chocolate/chocolate chip cookies. Makes 24."
ATKLOMDBJL0QM,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Awesome Brownie Mix....,"You won't miss the gluten in this mix...in fact, your non-gluten-free friends will love this as much or more than their favorite brownie recipe.  These bake up moist and rich, with none of those chemical ingredients you will find in other commercial brownie mixes.  YUM!!"
A2Q6HOOMIJPYQ,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Awesome brownies!,These gluten-free brownies match up with Ghiardhelli's Triple Chunk Brownie Mix.  I add chocolate chips to give them a little twist.  My whole family enjoys these.  This is the best gluten-free dessert I've found.
A3QRA16OY97F1V,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,"Wow...the best, most easy desert ever...","I buy this product because I am gluten intolerant and have not found gluten-free ready made deserts that I will eat.  I don't always have time to bake homemade BUT this brownie mix tastes like homemade and it's so moist and yummy!  The rest of my family can eat regular brownies BUT they can't tell that these are gluten free.  The only bad thing about these brownies, is they don't stick around long at my house.  TRY them, you won't be sorry."
A16DOFSW5GGV99,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,yummy,Granddaughter requires gluten free so thought we would try this - big success - actually tasted pretty good.
AR5YCBPFBPMHE,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,grab one before they're gone!,this popular desert was gone almost as quick as it came out of the oven..everyone loved..Pamela's you're the best!
AYTNYZKO6FTQ5,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Not the best,These brownies had that 'off' taste that you sometimes get with GF baked goods.  I prefer the Bob's Red Mill mix.
A2T48PQJVD8KIW,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Amazing Brownies,"I have been off gluten for three months and although I am getting used to being deprived of my favorite desserts, it does not make it fun.  Pamela's products are by far the best gluten free deserts around and the brownies are the best!  Unlike other gluten free products that are dense and dry, these brownies are moist, light, and delicious. Even people who can have gluten will love this product."
A232JN26X69RY8,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,"Gritty, grainy, sludgy","Everyone raves about Pamela's mixes, so I had high hopes. My kids seem to like them, so that's good. Perhaps if I had eaten them fresh from the oven I would have liked them more. I ate one the next day and found it to be the usual grainy, gritty texture I associate with gluten free products. After a few chews it was like a mouthful of mud. I will definitely be looking for something else."
A2NWIBURBR217A,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Great fir being gluten free,"I recently found I that I have an allergy to gluten products. I wasn't really a fan of the products I found on my local groceries shelf, I thought I would give this a try. They taste pretty good, not as good as the normal every day kind you get off the shelf. Be careful not to overcook them as they can be dry. I made these with dairy free white chocolate chips and another batch with walnuts mmm did they taste good! I would buy again as Amazon is the best price I have found it!"
A16YOST5C6PQBY,B000DZKKK2,Brownies,Wheat free brownie mix,The wheat free brownie mix is not to my liking.  I won't be reordering. I'd rather not eat chocolate than to eat these brownies.
A33P7CVPGAGS2T,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Worst taste. Bring back the old.,Kraft changed the bottle and taste. My kids and I don't like it and now I am searching for the last remaining bottles to buy before looking for another Catalina dressing. And it won't be this one. Why change a good thing?
A3TH7OFIO3UENQ,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,"Horrible Job, Kraft!","Update of 05/20/2012:<br />The photo on Amazon features the ""New Taste"" Catalina product (carefully examine the label), yet the title line for the product includes the word ""Classic"" in the product available from the 'Ozbo' supplier.  Be very careful about what you buy.  Some time ago, Kraft finally relented and brought back the 'classic' Catalina after lots of negative commentary about its ""New Taste"" Catalina formula.<br /><br />My Previous Entry:<br />I purchased a bottle of 'new' Catalina dressing at our local supermarket to try it out.  What a disaster!  DO NOT purchase this 'new taste' product if you are expecting the traditional Catalina dressing."
AFCPE7Y34ATB9,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,New Catalina,"OMG... what did you do with the most delicious-tasting Catalina that you used to have?  Changing the Catalina dressing has to be the worst possible thing that Kraft could have EVER even imagined doing, most less actually doing it.  The new taste is AWFUL!  Please bring back the old and completely rid yourselves of this new, disgusting so-called dressing.  If you want a new dressing in your line, just name it something else; DO NOT change the existing one that so many people LOVE!  The new name for this should be Spiced Castor Oil!!"
A2LP1ZP8E7UQSC,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Kraft has really messed up this time,"I threw out the ""new improved"" stuff and went to a local restaurant supply where I bought a gallon of the old stuff.  I broke it down into smaller containers and froze it.  It thaws perfectly.  Too bad there are no negative star ratings."
A2L2QN68VKEF1P,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,good god why?,"Why has humanity taken a step backwards? This obvious overstatement is a reflection of what I think about this ""new taste"". The dressing has lost everything about it that made it good. I love salads and this is the only dressing I use on them. Its going to be a difficult struggle to find something that will replace the old Catalina; yet it is something that must be done because this stuff is horrible. Kraft, may god have mercy on your soul."
A3IT8RX8R7WKZX,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Swimming Against the Tide!  We Actually Like This Dressing!!,"Well, I hate to be the ""Lone Ranger"" here, but we actually like this dressing.  I had completely forsaken the old traditional Catalina because it contained high fructose corn syrup.  I was THRILLED to be able to buy Catalina again and not have to make my own (which while good, wasn't exactly the same).  What a drag when you eat taco salads as often as we do.  To be truthfully and brutally honest, I can't tell much difference between the old and the new.  I think there had been some ""formula"" changes down the road because in later years, the Catalina didn't taste the same as I remembered in my earlier days.  Sorry if this offends all of you bashers out there!  I was very pleased to be able to purchase this conveniently through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program."
A333Q2TFYF0W1E,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,"I hate the ""new"" Catalina!",The new Catalina dressing is awful. The 1st time I bought it I thought it was bad & took it back to the store for a refund. I no longer buy Kraft dressings on a regular basis like I used to. Now I buy other brands as they go on sale. So much for Kraft caring what the public thinks. They might as well take this product off the shelves as it appears by these posts that they are not selling to many.
A1AW39KJZZ4YFC,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,New Catalina is NASTY!,What a bunch of wankers @ Kraft. They destroyed the best salad dressing of all time.
AXA9CQ8ULTZ5W,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Not for me!,"I used to be a loyal Kraft Catalina customer, but since Kraft decided to change the formula, I will no longer purchase it.  I have been using Marzetti's Honey French which is great (IMHO).<br /><br />PS:  Kraft also seems to be ignoring irate customers on it's forum."
A3TAS1AG6FMBQW,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,"Kraft needs to drop petroleum derived food colors such as FD&C Blue 1, causes extreme GI issues","My husband recently came home with yet another bottle of Kraft Catalina Salad Dressing laden with toxic substances. I had to dispose of the slightly used bottle after consuming a very healthy salad then living on the toilet doubled over in severe abdominal distress.... buyer beware. A waste of money and a waste of several unpleasant hours on the toilet on an otherwise gorgeous fall day.<br /><br />Kraft, please stop including petroleum derived food colors such as FD&C Blue 1 from Catalina Salad Dressing (and other Kraft products) since blue 1 is known to cause many adverse reactions including extreme GI issues- nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and much much worse."
A1GYVU4YLMJH4L,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Tangy Tomato Bacon......new label!!!!,"This is THE best salad dressing.  I've had Catalina, as well as Sweet Honey Catalina and liked them both very much.  However I am obsessed with Tangy Tomato Bacon....the new Catalina.  I've been a fan for over 7 years.  When I moved to Manhattan I had to have friends and family ship this salad dressing to me, since it is the only way I will eat a salad. Not sure why Kraft decided to change the name of Tangy Tomato Bacon & get rid of the old Catalina.......and honestly don't care since they made the right decision in keeping this flavor! Love it, Love it, Love it! It's seriously DEE-lish! Finally Kraft did something right and finally I'm able to buy it at Food Emporiom (or Amazon when I don't want to wait for restocking)! Thanks Kraft! (wink) :)"
A1CC8BIUMIT3YT,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Classic is BACK!,"Thank goodness they switched back to the old formula.  What were they thinking.  I stopped buying it a while back and my spouse bought some on accident.  I was about to throw it away, but I hate to waste food.  To my surprise it tasted good!  They call it ""classic"" now.  Some marketers ought to be fired over that one."
A1FDSB49OSS3V6,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,"The ""NEW COKE"" of salad dressings","The original Catalina is the only dressing I loved. I have carried it to restaurants who did not offer it! The new Catalina is so digusting I threw it away . (I offered to give it away but one taste and everyone said no thanks) I can only hope Kraft realizes they have made the same mistake as Coke did when they came out with New Coke. This dressing is not OK, it is horrible. I would only eat it if I were starving. I contacted Kraft and got the usual line. (taste tested, consumers like it, blah, blah) I cannot imagine anyone liking this. It tastes like vinegar and white pepper.If you loved the old Catalina PLEASE contact Kraft to let them know your feelings. It's our only hope. This is supposed to be healthier....well it can't be healthier if you can't stand to eat it. They could have extended the original line and given consumers a choice. Really I just cannot imagine that anyone at Kraft could think this is even palatable. Thinking of the taste makes me sick. Thinking about never having my favorite dressing again makes me furious."
AJEQC1E39QG3V,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Lousy new taste,"The ""New"" taste is horrible. They've ruined a really good thing. I will no longer buy it."
A1FTDAV90BYRAB,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Kraft Catalina What Happened?,"The new formulation of a this standby product is terrible. The taste  and smell have lost their zing and freshness. I can no longer use the is product. The only reason for the  ""new coke"" Catalina, must be it is cheaper to make."
A1BNOEA5VH174Q,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,New Kraft Catalina Dressing is TERRIBLE!!!,The New Kraft Catalina Dressing is TERRIBLE and Kraft knows it. There are not any positive comments on it anywhere on the internet including Kraft's own website. Everybody hates it! But Kraft seems insistent that they are going to shove this terrible new stuff down your throat!  The fact that they are sticking with it shows that it must be WAY cheaper to manufacture -and they are so arrogant - and think that they are so big-  that they can dictate to the consumer and not the other way around.
AFP0G307I07F2,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,"Catalina ""Classic"" Is Back!","We just found ""Classic Catalina"" at Walmart!  Seems they realized their horrible mistake and brought the old formula back in August 2009.  I just got off the phone with them about this.  Get this - They say the only change is that they went back to artificial preservatives.  They said the change in taste is entirely due to the preservatives used.  What a bunch of bull.  Coke used the same kind of bogus explanation when they brought back ""Classic Coke"".  Hopefully Kraft has learned its lesson.  The babyfaced marketing MBA's at Kraft were probably still in pre-school when Coke screwed up.  Apparently this was not covered in their business classes."
A2QHJ318EGVKY1,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,What a waste...,"Once the most popular salad dressing in America Kraft's Catalina brand dressing, once an icon, is no more. From the fake red dyed color to the off and slightly spoiled, rotten smell this ""new"" version of America's favorite should be avoided. I am certain some 24 year old MBA probably got a nice promotion out of wringing a few cents of expense per bottle this receipe probably saves Kraft. Frankly, and thankfully, there are a number of receipes available that let you make a fine home made version of the original. Try those instead of this product."
A3PTUXJN9UH6G0,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Vile & Nasty stuff!,"Here is my rant on the ""new"" Kraft Catalina dressing. It is the vilest and nastiest stuff I've ever put in my mouth!!! I HATE it! I called to complain on their 800 number and the minimum-wage phone jerk told me how they put all their products under taste testing samples and market research. Well, those people they tested must not have any taste buds. Regardless, we don't have Catalina dressing anymore and I don't believe that Kraft is going to listen to us. While this decision is similar to the Coca-Cola disaster in 1985, it doesn't have the same economic impact that the Coke had. Millions of people don't consume Catalina every second of every day like Coke does, so while Kraft might notice some sales declines, I think their stubborn, marketing-minded mentality will keep the new product on the shelves. Too many corporations these days are more concerned with dollars and ""new and improved"" products than maintaining tried-and-true products with loyal customers. These corporations are being infiltrated with young college graduates who don't know, nor care, about value and time-honored traditions. For them, everything is about dumping the old simply because it's old and not relevant anymore. This is happening in all areas of our lives. Anyway, in my refund check from Kraft, they thanked me for being a loyal Kraft customer and looked forward to my continued support. They are so large that they don't have a clue as to what's going on. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I told that phone jerk that I was boycotting ALL products that Kraft makes. I am very angry that they messed with this dressing. I have found an alternative at Wal-Mart. They have their Great Value brand dressing in Honey French and Homestyle French flavors. The better of the two is the Honey French; however, if you combine the two dressings in equal amounts you have a nice tasting French dressing very similar to Catalina. Of course, if you go with the Honey French by itself, it is very similar to the Catalina taste. All that said, the old Catalina had the best balance of flavors and zinginess that I liked. It's so sad!"
A1AHCGTESFID8L,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,Horrible change!,"Kraft completely ruined this dressing with the recipe change. The new stuff is a terrible, nasty concoction, like the original recipe made with rancid ingredients."
A34OJL240K2MGJ,B000E1HW0G,Salad Dressing,The new flavor is AWFUL. Bring back the old one!!,The new flavor change is nasty. The old one was my favorite dressing ever. Go to Stater Bros Grocery Store and buy their Catalina version!! It's almost identical to the old Kraft flavor!

A17RZUM0T1OA8K,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE 'EM!!!",LOVE THEM!!<br /><br />The Glutino GF Pretzel Sticks are my very favorite.  They are great for dipping.  Any pieces that are broken I save to put on top of a bowl/cup of soup.  They stand up well to carry a few in a plastic baggie and keep in my purse.<br />Before going gluten-free stick pretzels were a favorite and now the delicious Glutino GF Pretzel Sticks are.
A23PYE23K916II,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great GF Pretzels,"I find so little GF products that I really love. I do without rather than suffer the flavor.  This is, to the best of my memory, as good as Snyders.  This does not taste GF at all!!!"

As good if not better than ""normal"" pretzels!","I have been gluten free for over two years and have gotten quite used to gluten free snacks having their own ""special"" taste somewhat like cardboard with the gritty after mouth feel to remind you that they are healthy.  LOL.  These pretzels are even better than I remember ""normal"" pretzels to be.  My husband who is not gluten free constantly steals my stash.  I do not live in the US and have to go through a complicated process to get them as AMAZON only delivers these to US mainland addresses. They are worth every bit of the expense and complications as they are really really fantastic."
A3CRMOKFI6TDFG,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,yumm,This is one gluten free item that rates far above pretzels containing gluten. Much better than butter pretzels whlich used to be MY favorite.......just have to remember that I bought them for HIM.
A3L3ODU8BVDS0M,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best Gluten Free Pretzels,I love these pretzels.  Even friends and family who don't have to eat gluten free love them.  They have just enough salt and the texture is great.

AO2FRZTDDGAKW,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,best Prezels,"These are wonderful. They are a bit pricey, but if you want a Gf prezel that tastes JUST like the wheat prezels, then these are for you.  I just hope Amazon puts these on special again soon."
A3CYUUXAI6BJN2,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best GF pretzels!,I love these pretzels and the Amazon price makes them even better.  They are $8.19 in my local store so I gave up buying them until I found them on Amazon.<br />They taste better than wheat pretzels to me.  My GF kids love them too!

A1420YCB7AB5MQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Gulten Free,Let's face it. If you have Celiac disease and have to be Gulten free you are very limited in what you can eat. Before I was diagnosed I loved pretzels and while nothing Gulten free tastes as good as the real thing this products comes very close. I now eat them every day and buy the product by the case. I would highly recommend to anyone who cannot eat Gulten to try this product as in my case it is a life saver!
A2EX8VXBM163UQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,awesome pretzels!,"Although it is my daughter that has Celiac Disease, I try everything she eats.  These pretzels taste great, if not better than 'regular' ones.  Most of everything by Glutino is very good.  Highly suggest!"
A2XL6TZM34HFV3,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,I like them much more than regular pretzels,"My son's celiac so we buy these pretzels by the case.  I was never a big fan of pretzels but I eat these all the time.  They''ve got just the right amount of crunch and salt, and they're good for dipping in things like hummos.  My kid loves them too.  They're a bit expensive but definitely worth it."

A34O0980YBRQMS,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Not just for Celiacs,"Most GF pretzels, cookies, etc. that are trying to be substitutes for wheat products always taste ""off.""  These pretzels are great! Crunchy, slightly salty, no dry rice taste. My boyfriend likes them as well as regular wheat based pretzels.  Watch for a sale and they are a terrific deal."
A2MXQ8HR34VLV,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Pretzels,I would never guess that these pretzels were gluten free if I had not read the label.
A1Y2K97MHVY08K,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino gluten-free Pretzels,These are great.  They are just like a regular pretzel.  It's so wonderful to eat something that is like you used to eat.
A3RY1WTSRK1H26,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,wow - hard to believe the quality!,one year ago i found out i had to eat gluten free and so many things like this are simply awful. WOW! What a fantastic surprise to try these very tasty pretzels! Thanks Glutino - almost everything I have tried from this brand has been quite good....
A1MAZD6BBYAMOR,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,The best GF pretzels!,"All the other GF pretzels I've tried have an ""off"" flavor. These ones don't! They have a great texture and flavor. I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!"
A1UGNOPINPL36E,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,The BEST GF pretzels available,"We have tried MANY GF snacks and these are our families favorites. Most brands of GF pretzels are hard and flavorless. Not these! Light, crisp and yummy, we tear through them at our house!<br /><br />My 3 year old and I are the GF members of our household, but everyone loves them! My 11 year old generally thinks all things GF are ""ick"" by default, but she inhales these. Many of my kids friends say they are the best pretzels they have had, and they have no idea they are GF.<br /><br />We mix them with Rice Chex (GF but not other types of Chex or generic brands), raw almonds and chocilate chips for a yummy snack mix we call ""Finnie Mix"" - named for my 3 year old. Good stuff!<br /><br />We also grind them with raw almonds and use them as a fabulous breading for chicken nuggets.<br /><br />They are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The subscription offer from Amazon is a great deal (about $2-3 less per bag than any of the stores in my area) if you want to drop $60ish bucks at once."
AJEA4B0RKCWVC,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Snack for Gluten free kids,Sometimes it is hard to find a quick snack for Gluten free kids.  These pretzels are the best of all the GF pretzels we have tried. We leave a bag at my sons preschool for snack time. He loves them.

A11UFTST7LGE4P,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,pretzels,These pretzels are nice and crispy.  They have good flavor and are a close match to wheat pretzels.  They also hold up well if your kids want to use them for dips.
A37NGVCZJTUEVK,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,The best!,Even my friends and family who are not restricted to a gluten free diet say these are the best pretzels they have ever tasted.
A1X77D24I3IFQP,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Absolutely Great,These are the best pretzels.  I can't believe they are gluten-free and taste great.  Our family actually like them better than regular pretzels.
AUZYH859VRV1L,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Pretzels,"You wouldn't think these are missing anything, but they don't taste just like pretzels. But they're good enough for my sons friends and I catch my husband taking a few bites."

A15BNZ7QIK71XA,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino pretzel sticks are great!,"I regularly buy the Glutino pretzel sticks for my family. We had been missing pretzel sticks after going on the gluten free diet and were so happy to find these. They taste really great, almost like their wheat counterparts. Each of the many bags we've eaten has always been fresh and crunchy - never stale. A bag of these pretzels doesn't last very long in our house."

These Gluten free pretzels taste great. They're light, taste just like regular pretzels, and have just the right amount of sea salt. I was a bit concerned when I read the sodium content, but figured I could just brush the extra salt off...no need. Both of my finicky kids love them, & I've even shared them at outtings with other children & adults who had no clue that these pretzels were gluten free. I would definitely order them again."
A2J1MM9A9F9LX9,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,A great snack choice!!,I just bought these for the first time. WOW! They are wonderful--not at all  something that simulates  pretzel taste. Many times the  gluten free products I try are not even a good imitation of the real thing. This is not the case with these pretzels. I took them to my office and let everyone try them. I had a hard time keeping everyone away after one taste!<br /><br />One serious word of caution--They are so good you will find yourself eating more than you should!
A29ROD0QEENLIV,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"Best darn pretzels, GF or not","These are the best pretzels we've ever eaten, and by far the best tasting gluten free product.  My family loves these, and it's only my son who has to eat gluten free.  It's nice to be able to give my son something that I don't feel like is a lesser product taste-wise than the ""regular"" version.  So glad to be able to buy them by the case since they are hard to find in stores.  The pretzel sticks seem to taste better than the traditional shaped pretzels--don't know why--could be mental on my part."
A20IBTI69TK1RJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Delicious,"My nephew is a picky eater. He would only eat cheddar goldfish. Recently, he was put on a gluten free diet and we were worried that we wouldn't be able to satisfy his cravings for something crunchy but gluten free. We started experimenting with all kinds of snacks and he hated pretty much everything. When he tried these pretzels, he wouldn't put them down. He won't even share!! They are delicious and he doesn't even ask for the goldfish anymore."

A2EIR9OOMS02YZ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Good Product!,My daughter is on a Gluten-Free Casein-Free diet and this is one of the only snack foods I can get her to eat.  3yr olds aren't known for their desire for new and different foods so this has become a staple snack food for her.
A2D304KNXVYCVO,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Gluten Free Product,"I actually like this product better than regular pretzels, which is good because I'm a celiac.

A1NEKZGA107RFY,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Pretzels,"Gluten free pretzels never tasted so good.

AK8LOFYRZJJW0,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Just As Good As Wheat Pretzels.,"My kids were pretzels addicts before being finding out they had a wheat intolerance, so these pretzels were one of our first gluten-free purchases.

A3VJ6AOIZLT3WQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Comes from so far away,"This product comes to us from the Middle East, which represents so much carbon impact for a food product that gluten-free folks (such as myself) may be purchasing frequently.  There are other gluten-free products made in this country which have similar quality...which is how I'm going to spend my money."
A3L35NP2WR87LI,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,These are wonderful!,My son lives on these pretzels.  They are a life-saver as a snack for school or outtings.  He is very picky and I have to admit that they taste better than regular pretzels.  We are so grateful for such a tasty product.
A2UK6D92GA4PJR,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!,"I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!"
A2AHF0C1VWCQVM,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,These are the best!,"Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried, these by far are the best.  They are close to the real thing as I recall.  Sometimes they are difficult to obtain.  Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  These are a must for me."
A3LIF253SVDRMW,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with ""side effects"" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!"
A2I93YZN7KBTRC,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great product but needs to be packed better,"As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.  Nice and crispy and good flavor.  Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the ""fragile"" that was printed on the box.  Not good thinking."

My daughter-in-law bought the Glutino gluten free pretzel twists for the kids and when I tasted them, I was hooked!!! They are, hands down, the BEST PRETZELS I've ever had.

A1NECUZI01IU79,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Gluten Free Pretzels,"Mmmmmmmmmm.... This is all I can say. This is a great snack. It is better tasting than wheat pretzels I hear from everybody including I myself say so, too! Crunchy, tasty, and great!"

He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight ""burnt"" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips."
A39MSWHO0X5JUL,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Gluten free pretzels,I did not expect these to taste just as good as regular pretzels but they do. Even my husband likes them and he usually turns his nose up at my wheat free foods.  For the first time I can fix Chex Mix with these and Rice Chex and enjoy it along with every one else.  Hurray for Gluten Free Pretzel Twists!
A1YN7KUADY6QJ1,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Better than the sesame gluten free pretzels,The pretzels aren't bad for those of us that have to maintain a gluten free diet.  They are tastier than the pretzels with sesame seeds.
A22MDIU1U1ZMTU,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best Gluten-Free Pretzel - I love these!!!,I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.
AK8LOFYRZJJW0,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Better than wheat pretzels.,"My kids love pretzels, and when we found out that we had celiac disease, the first thing they realized was that they couldn't have pretzels anymore!  Within a few weeks, I found these at a health food store, and we've been hooked ever since.  They are even better that wheat pretzels and now they're a snack staple in our house."
A2EX8VXBM163UQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,excellent,My daughter was diagnosed with Celiac Disease at age 8.  She is now 11. These pretzels taste great!  They taste like a 'regular' pretzel.  My son who does not have to eat G.F. says they taste better.  Glutino brand is a very good brand in general.  Highly recommend.
A2ACH23JU7KFHD,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Gluten free pretzels,Products work great in Chex mix and by themselves.  Great for all celiac sufferers
A3G991Z5SNSDX4,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Tasty !,"These taste as good as ""normal"" wheat based pretzels - we discovered them locally at a health food store, but the price was crazy high.  Much cheaper on line.<br />But buyer beware - 12 packages of these come in a big box !"
APGI1V8JVIBFS,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,A GREAT Tasting Pretzel!,These are the best tasting pretzels! I can not tell the difference between Glutino Pretzels and the regular pretzels made from wheat.
A28C6L6BEV9UG2,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Thank you Glutino,"Was pleasantly surprised how delicious these pretzels are and there is no odd aftertaste as with some gluten free products.  Perfect for munching and the pretzel sticks stay fresh in the bag for quite a while, that is if you can resist finishing the bag.  Would purchase again."
A1482V19UP7PP9,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,AL,"We find these pretzels better than the ""real"" ones. I order them by the case!"
ACVEM04I0TSOR,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best gluten-free pretzels,"These pretzels are so good - so much like the ""real thing"" for those of us who cannot eat gluten -(wheat,barley,rye and oats).  We recommend them highly!"
AIW5RUEVEUTE0,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Yum!,"Just bought a case of these, and they are fabulous.  I love pretty much anything from Glutino.  My sister, who does not have CD, thought they were great too."
A2NGVWIRBNPJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,excellent,These pretzels are extremely good tasting.  Very difficult to tell the difference compared to pretzels with gluten.
AV1N1VPAI6Z6G,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Pretzels everyone likes to eat!,These gluten free pretzels are enjoyed by everyone.  Friends have even said they taste better than their regular pretzels.
ALQ5NGBAM7P3J,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,The Best Gluten Free Pretzels around!!,You will not waste your money...simply the best!! You can't have just one!!
A3OUGMBIAUJN8N,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Tastes Just Like Regular Pretzels!,"We had been eating the Glutino regular pretzels for a few years now and they were okay, but recently our health food store started carrying these.  I bought a bag and we enjoyed them so much I was back buying a few more.  Pretzels are one thing I've missed since going gf - but not any more!  Taste great with dip, too!"
A5SLR3QI4V4NJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Perfect!,I'd never heard of Glutino before. I bought a snack pack of these pretzels at a health food store. They cost a fortune. I was shocked when Amazon had them by the case. What a great find for my son on the GFCF diet. They taste great. No different than other pretzels. We bought a whole case. We love them! Thanks so much Glutino.
AJ086E9A5FS2S,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,May not be totally gluten free,"I ordered this for my mom, who has Celiac disease. She could not tolerate it, it gave her bad diarrhea, as if it had gluten in it."
A30JYOIR0U7KSG,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"Potato-y taste, bad texture","In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a ""real"" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than ""real"" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to ""real"" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists."
ARRLVOWNWTDU3,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"Yummy, but 6 grams of fat per serving!","These pretzels have been a wonderful treat since discovering I am gluten sensitive, but at 6 grams of fat a serving you need to be careful of how many you eat!  Would rate them at five stars if they contained less fat, but then they might not be as yummy..."
A15XPSV4VTY8HV,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Our favorite gluten free pretzel,"After trying a few other brands of gluten free pretzels, these are our favorites, especially for our 17 year old son.  He has actually been known to say ""Hey, those pretzels are mine!  You can eat whatever you want, so hands off!!"".  Yummy and worth the extra $$$."
A7GD4QDJHDX0C,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,yummy yummy,"these pretzels are great! these taste better than non gluten free pretzels. crunchy, tasty just the right amount of salt.  great snack option for restricted diets."
A18H31MR172T1J,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"delicious, crunchy","these are awesome. though they're gluten free, they taste wayyyy  better than regular pretzels. they're crunchier, no bad aftertaste or anything, and taste buttery. only thing is, you have to make sure you put leftovers in a sealed bag or else they get stale quickly, but overall awesome."
A3JF2A0JXQC1Y8,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels,I absolutely love these pretzels.  I am very disappointed that I can no longer buy them on Subscribe & Save.  Don't know who's at fault with this but I wish you could get it worked out.
AT1IMJ0J9LE32,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels,"If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more ""carbs"" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of ""palor"", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy ""chip"" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY"">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
A1HKW2TELCHGLL,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,These are the BEST gluten free pretzels,My wife and children are gluten intolerant and we searched for good pretzels for a long time. We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price. Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.
A1QS4MRVF1T6I6,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels,"Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!"
AK1ASF87UDS8X,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Pretzels!,"Love these pretzels, I actuallly think they have better flavor than regular pretzels.  And my kids eat them up too."
A1V8WXQK53UTNQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,glutino products are the best,glutino pretzels are fresh tasty and best gluten free foods you can ever buy. i recomend this product for all who need to keep wheat away from their diet.<br /><br />awasome product and company.
A1OEXW2VO7E8SC,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Yum!,These are really great. You never know what to expect with gluten free products. You can't even tell it's gluten free. Thank you!
AAEGIBOD9UGOL,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Better than regular,I don't miss regular pretzels one bit after finding these -- they are even better!  Save the seeds in the bottom of the bag for topping soups!
A33AQPJYH7UUXR,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"better than ""regular""!!!","These pretzels taste great! I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most ""regular"" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU"">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended."

AJ0CQ0L127LAY,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"Better than ""regular"" pretzels","These pretzels are available at the Publix near me. They cost more than regular pretzels, but our entire family (only our daughter is gluten intolerant)prefers these pretzels over gluten pretzels. They are excellent and I highly recommend them. Crunchy, salty, yum!"
A2FNTZVE5KCQL1,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Pretzels!!!,I love these pretzels!! The taste like real pretzels! Glutino is a great brand and I buy many of their products. Anything time I am trying a new alternative to a gluten-containing food and a Glutino product is available I always start with them!!
AH55S1FV7JZRJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"Love these, but....","I'm just so sick of the price gouging on GF foods!  That said, these are delicious and I'd choose these over regular pretzels."
AIQ7S0ND2NJ7T,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great pretzels!,"I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten-free diet.  They taste great!  I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them."
A3BSPXD2A2UQ2T,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great Taste!!!,"These are better than ""regular"" pretzels. They are light and crunchy with a buttery taste. I am so glad to have found these. They restored hope that I can have good food without the ""aftermath"" that typically comes with eating.<br /><br />My mother, who has no problem with gluten, tried them and liked them. She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like ""normal"" pretzels."
A2E6N9Y9K75PGA,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,THE Best Pretzels = they are better than those with gluten,MY husband cannot became alergic to gluten about a year ago and thus we have been trying all kinds of products.  These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.  I can say these taste 10X better than any that I have had (regular / with gluten) - they have a fabulous taste.  I would recommend these if you like Pretzels - even if you can eat gluten they just taste great
A19GXRXQCP82ES,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,awesome pretzels!,These are really tasty! Rice Cakes are no longer the only gluten free snack. It's just so much a bonus that I can buy these bulk from Amazon.
A2700R03B4D9MA,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best pretzels,"These are hands down the best pretzels I've ever had. Since having to be gluten free, I've tried other brands, but truly prefer these. My non GF family prefer Glutino Pretzels to regular(poison) pretzels. My daughters friends always ask her to bring some to school. I have yet to find someone that can tell these are GF. Buying the case not only saves money, but I always have some on hand!"
A2EAVZGJJXFG3K,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,These are good!,"My girlfriend can't have any gluten, basically anything at all with wheat. Most of the gluten free products that would normally be made with wheat flour either taste weird or have a odd texture to them when you are chewing.<br />She came home with these the other day and they actually taste really good! Although most gluten free items seem a bit pricey I may buy a case of these for her, and help eat a few of them..."
A3R556J5NUYTIJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Yes yes yes!!!,"These are the absolute best GF pretzels.  My non gluten free family/friends think they are amazing as well.  I wish they had a bit of fiber in them, but most pretzels don't so its not a major drawback.  I adore the price of these as well, especially with Subscribe and Save.  I eat mine with peanut butter.  Yum!"
A2BJZ4UJAHRA19,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino  gluten  free pretzels,These pretzels are a nice treat.  They are not to salty and really good. I take them with me in the car so I have something to munch on if I get hungry.
AVGZ652W8N1SF,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Love these,These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.
A1DTC2PJWEKU4A,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,tastes like regular pretzels,"These pretzels taste like regular pretzels.  Being on a gluten free diet does not always satisfy my children's requests, but they love these pretzels.  Once a bag is open, it is sure to be gone!"
A2118182A88W1,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,"Buttery, Delicious, Wonderful!","These are simply the best pretzels I've ever eaten. Just a touch of salt, buttery, crunchy. OK, now really, are you sure they're gluten free???? OMG, so good. The ones with the sesame seeds are amazing too but I liked these a lot better. Pop one in your mouth with a square of dark chocolate. The best little bite of dessert."
AV416RROMXFO9,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Thank goodness!,"I was so happy to discover these!  When I had to go gluten-free I thought I'd never snack on anything but berries and carrots ever again.  I prefer the low-sodium ones, and they honestly taste as good as the regular ones.  All of my friends eat them too, because they're even better than normal gluten-filled pretzles.  Thanks, Glutino!"
A1LV14I3QX7TQC,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Yum!,By far the tastiest GF pretzels I've tried.  I even have to hide them from my non-celiac family members so that they don't eat them all!
A1EG46F1145HQN,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best Pretzels EVER!,"The fact that these pretzels are gluten free is a bonus for sure! I, we...everyone I've had taste them agrees they are better than any pretzel we've ever had."
A3HLGRBAQ6NMRJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Better than regular pretzels!,"These are the best pretzels I've had, gluten free or otherwise.  They do break easily, but the taste is great...now if only picking a gluten free bread were as easy."
A1P1YTNPNHZXD5,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,I  would purchase this product again,This product is great.  If you are gluten free it is a must have in your house.  One of my granddaughters is not gluten free and she prefers  these to regular pretzels.
A2DWP8CZCOQTNE,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Gluten free,Glutino Gluten free pretzel sticks taste as good as pretzels with wheat flour.<br />The crunch and texture are excellent.<br />People not exposed to gluten free foods also enjoyed the pretzel.
A197OKILYY934X,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,I love these pretzels!!!,"I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels."
AG70IFAJJG09Z,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best pretzels at the best price!,"These pretezels are so good, you won't know they don't have wheat! They are crisp, buttery goodness. Also, the price on Amazon makes them affordable!"
A23R3C7B3L0X81,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,BEST GF Pretzel,"Christmas isn't complete without Party Mix. My mom started the tradition with a 1960's recipe from my great-aunt. Now I use that same recipe for my grown-up kids and their families using all gluten free ingredients. Glutino pretzel sticks are the best; they're light, with just enough salt, and none of that bitter after-taste that many gf pretzels have. They are my first choice."
A3D7NKLR56DZRA,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Best ever!,"I'm not much of a pretzel person, but these are perfect!!  I'm always hesitant with these types of products that are Gluten Free, but I thought I would try it and I am soo happy I did! Great crunch that I miss and no weird after taste.  Love these and will buy then again!"
A2ED6V249OPVDJ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,great pretzels,These are some of the best pretzels available.You will not know these are anything but the real thing.try it and you will like it
A1BZC6T2RTRQK9,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,taste,"I was shocked after tasting these to find that I like these better than other pretzels that are not gf, which is great due to having to switch to gf diet.  This makes a wonderful snack and the price is not that bad (even in the store, meijer's by me and whole foods both carry)"
A1RCLOFPWV3BJ3,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Forget about the rest... this is the best!,"I have two extremely picky eaters. They truly give air plants a run for their money as they eat only to live. As if that is not enough, both are gluten sensitive and allergic! I've been through every pretzel out there and nothing compares. I don't bother with ""regular"" pretzels. I put these out at parties and playdates and have been asked what brand they were as our guest noticed how tasty and fast they were going. Light, flavorful, and a satisfying crispy crunch. Awesome!"
A1USVMDNJT05UQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,great pretzels,tastes pretty close to the real thing..unfortunately the ones i ordered came in a little stale. ive ordered them from gluten-free website before and they tasted fresher.
A1S73WZTW3PP8M,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,So Yummy!,"They may be pricey, but dang are they great. One of my favorite Holiday Treats is Pretzels with melted Rolos on it and a Pecan, and I can have them again! Its so tough to have a easy snack for a GF lifestyle. These are Great! They taste awesome! This brings back all sorts of Yummy treats back to my world!"
A2HO898G5N5X05,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,A Terrific Snack that Goes Great with Coffee,"One of the best gluten free product I've tried. These Pretzels taste like the real deal! They go very fast at my house, I have to keep them coming. I pack them everyday in my brown bag and snack at them through out my work day. I love how they go with coffee."
A39179SV97PX4J,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,One of my favorite gluten-free snacks,"Oh, these are yummy.  Even my gluten-eating family loves them and says they're better than ""real"" pretzels.<br /><br />They're my dog's favorite snack too.  The only thing that could make them better is if they came in a honey mustard flavor."
A224I5WR8UQDDC,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Delicious,My daughter is gluten/casein free and these are our standard lunchbox snack.  Foods can be limited since most schools won't allow you to pack peanut products in lunchboxes due to peanut allergies in other children.  The Glutino Pretzels are the perfect thing.<br /><br />The taste is very close to a regular pretzel--perhaps more like a slightly stale regular pretzel.<br /><br />The subscribe and save option here on amazon makes these significantly less expensive than they are in stores.
A2422TU7CUU7K3,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Very good Pretzels,My wife who isn't celiac or gluten intolerant LOVES these pretzels... nice crunch and great taste.<br /><br />Because of their crunch I make so many snacks with them that other normal pretzels can't stand up to.<br /><br />Kudos to Glutino on this winner
A1K0WMTZ2EGZ5I,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Where have all the pretzels gone?,"I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food."
A1DK3BUYU3U9TU,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,My favorite pretzels,I don't eat Gluten so I am always looking for good Gluten Free snacks. Most are  like sawdust -- These taste better than regular pretzels.  I highly recommend them.
A1FOUC0WQXV2UG,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,gluten-free,My son needs as many gluten-free snacks as we can find! These are among the best although a little pricey in stores. Better to buy on Amazon.com.
A1FWFCJU2G7TRA,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,I Take These to Family Parties!,"Once my family tasted these at a party I threw, they love it when I bring them to their house to share for gatherings. Every person that has tried them, LOVE them. Very dense, crisp and satisfying you will not know they are gluten free--you'll just know they taste better than the rest. For those of us that are used to paying prices for GF food, these are not that far off. I also tend to savor them more, knowing they are a bit more costly than the rest."
A2325YER3LWYTK,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Terrific GF pretzels!,Glutino pretzels are by far the best tasting on the market.<br />These actually made my kids believe that being GF wasn't going to be so bad<br />if they could still have a good pretzel to snack on!
A266ZC0U3JP84N,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino Pretzels,"I have a gluten problem and have a great appreciation for these pretzels. I have no problem with Glutino pretzels, and think they are so much better than any other I have tried. I will order again."
AFDYUGR3L22IZ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Delicious and gluten free!,"These gluten free pretzels taste BETTER than regular pretzels.  They are light and crunchy, but they still taste like pretzels should.  If you are sensitive to gluten (and even if you aren't) I'd recommend trying a few...you could be pleasantly surprised."
AN5UJ0QX6M5YQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Glutino Pretzels are great!,"If you are a Celiac, or are gluten intolerant, you won't find a better pretzel than the Glutino brand.  I have them on Auto-Delivery with Amazon."
A2Q6HOOMIJPYQ,B000EVIDWW,Pretzels,Great gluten-free pretzel!,My 4 year old loves these pretzels.  They have a sweet salty taste.  We use them as snacks and in recipes.  They do have more fat content than most pretzels.  Not a big deal for a kid though!  Best price is on Amazon with the discount and free shipping.  Grocery store sells them for ~$7.59.
A198UX2FCPAMYT,B000FICDO8,Beans,great product,"I love these dehydrated refried beans.  You simply add water and they are ready.  SO much better than canned refried beans.  No ""canned"" taste.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you try this product.<br /><br />Cheryl"
A2SZ7A7H83CIXK,B000FICDO8,Beans,Good eating,"Great flavor, fast easy to prepare...makes great chalupas, bean dip, and thickens the juice of friojoles for cornbread & beans.<br /><br />Wish I had room to store a case."
A1OVB57TR42AR0,B000FICDO8,Beans,Comparison:  Santa Fe Bean Company versus Taste Adventure,"Santa Fe Bean Company:<br /><br />-- Mild cereal flavor, similar to corn flakes (which I prefer).  Moderate sodium taste; in fact, this brand tastes as though it has more sodium, contrary to the nutrition labels.<br /><br />-- Some clumping of dry bean flakes.  Rehydrate slightly less rapidly, although no problem.  Two halves of an unflaked bean found, after the contents of ~5 packages consumed; no damage to my teeth.<br /><br />-- Lower price per ounce.<br /><br />-- Convenient bag, durable and resealable.  No individual box to discard.<br /><br />  Taste Adventure:<br /><br />-- Mild bean flavor.  No significant sodium taste, although the nutrition labels indicate this brand has more sodium.<br /><br />-- No clumping of dry bean flakes.  Rehydrate quite rapidly.  No unflaked beans found, after the contents of >60 packages consumed.<br /><br />-- Higher price per ounce.<br /><br />-- Packaging less convenient.  A little bit of bean powder sometimes found in individual cardboard box.  Plastic bag not designed to be resealed."
A1FP5ZLSKR07SU,B000FICDO8,Beans,Better than canned,"I don't mind canned beans, but these are better, and I like the varieties. I got all three of the Santa Fe varieties available and my review is the same for each -- easy to prepare and yummy! Forget the cans and maintain these in your pantry. I use them for dips, for nachos, for a sidedish, instead of meat in lasagna, and whatever."
AF51KJB3W1YI6,B000FICDO8,Beans,Best Refrieds Yet ...,"These are, without a doubt, the best refrieds I've ever prepared and/or eaten ... and I'm a long time lover of refried beans.<br /><br />They are a snap to prepare. Although the directions say to cover and simmer for five minutes, I've found it best to turn the heat to low and stir uncovered for about three minutes or so, then remove the pan from the burner and let them sit covered for a couple more minutes.<br /><br />A quick comparison to a can of top brand 'fat free' refried beans shows that the Santa Fe Fat Free Vegetarian beans have less than half the sodium! And, because of the handy packaging, you can reduce the salt further by shaking the pouch first. This knocks some of the salt to the bottom. Then scoop the contents of the bag into the boiling water, leaving the salty residue at the bottom of the pouch - don't need it.<br /><br />Plus, there are so many additional things you can do with refried beans that are prepared this way. (e.g. add extra water for delicious bean soup or use as a great base for chili). The creative possibilities with this simple ""comfort food"" are endless.<br /><br />Oh, and they are a great value, also!"
A3GBJH97WH2FIU,B000FICDO8,Beans,Great for camping!,"I've used these for hiking and kayaking camp cooking. Lighter in weight than a can and easier to pack, the resealable foil pouch makes it easy to use a portion and save the rest for later, or a handy place to put leftovers. I've also snacked on the uncooked chips right out of the bag, although they are a bit salty. I've cooked a whole bag in a Jetboil PCS, but I recommend going with smaller portions, unless you're REALLY hungry, or have several people to feed. One bag makes a heap of refried beans."
A1P3OGE5TFJT1H,B000FICDO8,Beans,Awesome!,"These beans are the best and so much better than the canned variety in stores. Each package makes about 3 cups of beans, so they are also more economical than cans.<br /><br />I live overseas where I can't find even halfway good refried beans, and the ones I can find are outrageously expensive. When I go back to the U.S. each summer, I can bring these back because the packages are so lightweight."
A28MTZDW4H9NC6,B000FICDO8,Beans,As good as my mom's!,"I have to say that these beans are as good as my mom's home made. At first I wasn't sure how freeze dried beans would taste, no regrets. These are the best I've had and I've had them all! My recipe for them is: I heat up the water, add a tablespoon of olive oil or maybe bacon drippings, then add ground cumin to taste, garlic powder to taste, chili powder to taste, and onion powder to taste. Once it's all boiling I add the beans and mix until I get the consistency I like. Take it from someone who grew up on Mexican food... these suckers are good! Don't skip the oil part because the oil carries the flavors better. Also, no need for salt.<br />I don't get the southwestern because they have partially hydrogenated oil or something like that."
A348IT6M7H8A67,B000FICDO8,Beans,"Really easy, good, fat free!  Versatile and fast!","I love these dried refried beans.  I just add whatever seasonings I want like ground cumin, ground coriander, garlic, onions, be inventive and use your imagination!  Very easy and quick cooking.  You could even make these in a hot pot.<br /><br />My only problem is that I would like it if they would print directions for making smaller amounts of these than making the entire package at once.  They have a convenient zipper closure on the bag so that means they know that people may not make up the entire package at once.  I looked on their website and found that you just have to add equal parts water and bean mix.<br /><br />I am going to get some dried pinto beans and cook them and add these to them to be more like what I had in Mexico years ago.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had these for Subscribe & Save so I could get an even better price and have a regular supply.<br /><br />Amazon, please start carrying Santa Fe Bean Co. whole dehydrated pinto beans too!"
A2HXF7XCONT0GS,B000FICDO8,Beans,Great alternative to canned or cooking your own,"When I can, I love to make fresh pintos with tomato and roasted garlic. During the summer I am so busy I'll often put pintos out to soak and throw them away 2 days later. And roasting garlic in the summer doesn't often happen.<br /><br />These are a great substitute. I work 12 hour days in the summer so it's great to come home, boil these for 5 minutes, and be able to make whatever I want. I'm a veg* who grew up in the southwest, transplanted to the southeast and these are perfectly good ""refried"" beans esp. compared to canned. When I want really good, I'll cook real pintos but I'd rather use my little time make a good pico de gallo along with these easy to make, smooth and creamy beans."
A3UQA2FPBM4MYD,B000FICDO8,Beans,Absolutely ideal!,"I tried the regular variety <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI701Y"">Santa Fe Bean Co., Instant Southwestern Style Refried Beans, 7.25-Ounce Pack (Pack of 8)</a> first. Although I liked it, I was disappointed at how much salt had been added. Usually with fat-free varieties, there is more sodium than the regular equivalent, but in this case, the fat-free is lower in sodium. This turned out to be perfect for my tastes and nutrional needs. I use equal parts of this dried bean mix and water, then I add a little bit of Clint's Salsa (which is relatively low in sodium) and a little bit of shredded cheese. The result is both flavorful and still reasonably healthful."
A2UIDZVKG7D2MJ,B000FICDO8,Beans,Best Refried Beans Ever,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FICDO8"">Santa Fe Bean Co., Instant Fat Free Vegetarian Refried Beans, 7.25-Ounce Pack (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />I am so happy I found these beans on Amazon.  I used to buy them at Raley's/Bel Air, but they discountinued them for some reason.  They are so good, you can eat them out of the bag, like potato chips!  Not only are they delicious, but they are Fat Free and Vegetarian!  They are also very easy to make. They simmer in hot water for 5 minutes.  I hope Santa Fe never stops making these and Amazon never stops selling them!"
A9TT7VHXEAU17,B000FICDO8,Beans,Fabulous!,"These beans are so fast and easy to make.  I always try to keep some on hand.  I may add garlic powder, a little salsa, and some cheese."
A3N9TOPHBENB9I,B000FICDO8,Beans,"Great product, easy preparation","We bought this product in the past to ship to our daughter, who lives in China. Refried beans is one food item from home that she craves from time to time.  She can buy tortillas at an import store, but not the refried beans. Cans are too expensive to ship, so a dehydrated product is the perfect solution.<br /><br />Last time we bought a box to ship to her, we decided to taste the product ourselves.  We found that we agree with all the five-star ratings.  This stuff is good!  I was afraid that a dehydrated product would be finely powdered, and yield just pasty glop.  Much to my surprise, the product has good texture, comparable to canned refried beans.  This tastes much more like home-made beans than the canned version, however.<br /><br />We will be buying more for us!  Great product."
A3VOQNDCES5053,B000FICDO8,Beans,Yummy healthy alternative!,"These are pretty darn good for instant and vegetarian. They are a nice alternative to canned refried beans that contain lard. The nice thing about them is that you can add more or less water depending upon how thick you like your beans.<br /><br />Note: They are pretty bland, so you'll need to add some kick to make them spicy."
A2UMSCRZ5BZ0C3,B000FICDO8,Beans,Love these beans!,"Taste great, so much better than canned!! I also love this company's Black Beans as well."
A16WPA6JV83YXT,B000FICDO8,Beans,No canned beans compare!,"Quite simply, these are the closest you can get to homemade.<br />They taste great and are easy to store. Add our own spices if you want more flavoring and in less than 10 minutes you have refried beans for a side dish or to use for nachos or recipes calling for this ingredient.<br />I buy these regularly."
A2B5OI74EHGVH1,B000FICDO8,Beans,"Good refried beans, but too salty...","I agree with the other reviewers that these refried beans taste good, but I consider the salt content too high - both in terms of taste and health. Whenever I prepare these beans, I add salt-free corn to reduce the sodium content per serving, which helps. If the Santa Fe Bean Company would reduce the sodium content of this product by one-third, I would enthusiastically buy again. As it is, I probably won't, as I am watching my sodium intake."
AIZ3EPHTZTAU0,B000FICDO8,Beans,Best Refried Beans,These are the very best beans on the market ..After eating these you will never open another canned refried bean again....
A3OJDREFH6BAFD,B000FICDO8,Beans,Best Refried Beans Ever!,"My wife and I both LOVE these refried beans. They are very fast and easy to make, and they taste superb. I eat them plain a lot of the time. I would recommend these over canned refried beans any day!"
A36WGHR8TO5DKT,B000FICDO8,Beans,"Indeed, Good Beans","I used a similar product some years back, which was tasty, but had that negative ""magical fruit"" effect.  So I have since avoided anything like this.  However, I noticed in the reviews for this product that nobody mentioned any problems.  Thanks by the way, to all product reviewers - you help me so much with all of my online shopping decisions - I appreciate your taking the time to leave your reviews!<br /><br />These are the best packaged option.  Better than canned, dried, and many restaurants.  No ""magical fruit"" effects.  :)<br /><br />The package is a sturdy Zip-loc type bag that will stand upright in the cupboard.  Each bag has a good quantity of product, which you can scoop out for individual portions if you want (just mix equal parts beans and water).<br /><br />The result looks and tastes like real frijoles refritos (at least, non-lard ones), without an off, dehydrated flavor.  I'm not going to claim that you couldn't tell these from home cooked.  But they are better than any other option I've encountered.<br /><br />Finally, regarding saltiness - these seem just right to me, and I rarely eat salty foods or add salt.  Once a great Italian cook told me that all beans require some salt and fat, otherwise they are hard on your system.  She was right.  So, I add just a few drops of oil to these."
A3KJ6JZ8MWERPG,B000FICDO8,Beans,Wonderful!,It's hard to believe that the only ingredients are pinto beans and salt!  These are really tasty - they taste like they are seasoned.  You also cannot tell that they are fat free.  I would highly recommend them!
A18EAKIKA48AB0,B000FICDO8,Beans,Surprisingly tasty!,"My children and I really enjoy the texture and flavor of these beans. Preparation is simple (add to boiling water) and the result is so much better than any of the canned varieties we've tried. Whether used in burritos, on tostadas, or as a side dish, we never have leftovers."
ALFVOKCROM3GK,B000FICDO8,Beans,Instant refried beans,"Excellent product.  Just mix with hot water and they are ready in about 5 minutes.  They taste like the refried beans you get at a Mexican Restaurant.  Quick, easy to amke and very economical."
A2BILB4SKUYXVY,B000FICDO8,Beans,Delicious!,These beans are amazing!  I grew up with a Mexican babysitter who made her own refried beans and I could never get enough of them!  These are the FIRST beans that have ever come close to that homemade authentic flavor!  I love them.... sooo much better than canned.  These are fairly big bags and made about 3-4 cups of beans (about the size of 2 cans).  I'm buying more now!!!
APRCWWXN9S5KE,B000FICDO8,Beans,Great beans!,"We used to purchase dehydrated beans from Fantastic Foods, but when our local Whole Foods stopped carrying them and we couldn't find them elsewhere locally, we turned to Amazon. We saw these beans and figured we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Thank goodness we did. We love these beans, even prefer to them to the Fantastic Foods line. There's nothing to 'em, no seasonings, just dehydrated beans so the taste is clean. They heat up in a snap, too. Just add hot water, stir and wait a couple of mins. Super convenient.<br /><br />Best of all, Amazon ships them in a blink. I ordered them on a Friday and they arrived on Monday."
A11YOTONCPRQ9S,B000FICDO8,Beans,Great!,"Vegetarian.  Stores long-term.  Makes about a pound, the same as a can of beans.  Cost is right around 1.81 per container.  In comparison, a can of high quality, non-freeze-dried refried beans from Whole Foods is about 1.30.  But these are great for travel/trips and storing as emergency rations.  Tastes better than canned too.  I thought people were a little nutty for raving over these.  But they really are good.  Salt content is a bit high, so be careful."
A32YW4V65FB0YY,B000FICDO8,Beans,Easy Refried Bean delight,These are so easy to prepare.  I actually add a can of whole cooked pinto beans to a package of the dried beans--ends up tasting almost like my mom's homemade beans!
A38ZHOQCGNS0O7,B000FICDO8,Beans,Best Refried Beans Ever,"My family has eaten these beans, and the Santa Fe black beans also, for many years.  The quality is consistently very high.  Surprisingly, they taste every bit as good as the canned varieties, which are not as healthy.  Highly recommended."
A19LLXPCHI9N7O,B000FICDO8,Beans,Excellent!!!,"These are absolutely delicious and the best refried beans I have ever had. I gave a package to my brother to try and he too thinks they are the best he's ever had. In fact, I just ordered a case for him for his birthday. I also gave a package to a friend, who also thought there were really tasty. I will order these regularly. Don't hesitate to try them."
A3B5OLV01PVP85,B000FICDO8,Beans,Great taste with little effort.,"I actually bought these for my parents since they are going to be visiting India for a while.  Mexican food is not a hot commodity there!! With all of us being vegetarian, these are such a treat! Mom's told me that these beans are super tasty and very easy to make.  It's a great value because you can easily control the consistency of the beans with water, make as much as you want, and there is no 'taste addition' you have to do.  She likes them so much, I will be buying them again for her very soon....and this time I'll have to buy extra so I can keep some for myself!!"
A1V19GIRJMH5LI,B000FICDO8,Beans,Good substitute for homemade.,Homemade refrieds are clearly the most desirable.  Canned refrieds are unacceptable.  These are a good alternative to homemade.  Easy and quite good.  I add a little butter and olive oil to the vegetarian.  It makes them richer and smoother.  I buy the vegetarian because they have less sodium than the standard beans.
A35HVXQLD526SG,B000FICDO8,Beans,Very happy with product,We were very happy to find this product online to purchase since the store we used to purchase it from stopped carrying the it. We will purchase it again.
A1SJ0P1ZG2UV81,B000FICDO8,Beans,Best Beans,"I will never buy can beans after trying this package of beans. They are easy to make and taste homemade. I still make refried beans from scratch, but I have no time I just use one of this bags instead. Try them you will not be dissapointed."
A1PP4RU1JIQK76,B000FICDO8,Beans,Gret beans!,"These are great refried beans.  Easy and quick and delicious. No canned taste, either. Don't let the fact they are dehydrated put you off.<br /><br />Until just recently I was able to purchase them at my Raley's grocery store in northern CA but my store has discontinued them (BOO!).  Try these...you'll like them."
AG8IYOQUU2E5P,B000FICDO8,Beans,Love these beans!,I use to buy these in the the store and then for some reason they stopped carrying them. I found them on Amazon and was like THANK YOU!!!<br />They cook up great and not like the nasty taste of canned refried beans. i have tried sooo many brands and this hands-down has been the tops!
A1141MQVW57Z5W,B000FICDO8,Beans,The best beans you'll ever have in under 10 minutes,These beans are AWESOME!!!!<br />If you can boil water you can have beans that are better than almost any Mexican restaurant and that are actually healthy for you. My 6 yr. old and 18 month old can eat a whole bag themselves with a couple of tortillas.
A28KCEPCCJ8DYJ,B000FICDO8,Beans,Great refried beans!,"I have been buying these beans for over a year and sharing them with friends.  We think they are fabulous.  First, they are so quick and easy to make.  You can have great refried beans instantly!  I sometimes add a pinch of dried minced onion while the beans are cooking and a touch of garlic powder at the end.  Others add salsa, jalepenos, and cheese after the beans have been cooked.  It is totally up to you.  You could even add taco-seasoned ground beef.  You can eat them straight from a bowl or with chips as a dip or on nachos.  Also, you can put them on a tostada shell or crumbled tortilla chips and then top them with your favorite toppings (tomatoes, onions, black olives, cheese, shredded lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, etc.)  Instant Mexican haystacks!  I am trying to eat beans every day since they are so good for you, and this product makes that really easy to do.  I understand that Santa Fe Bean Co. has added a Borracho Beans product to their line.  I hope Amazon starts carrying that soon!"
A2MI0ZF22TCVI2,B000FICDO8,Beans,Yummy & healthy,"I eat a lot of beans & this sure is a handy way to make up a batch & put it in the fridge - I just measure equal beans & water, & make about 3 cups.  I don't have a car, so otherwise I'd be buying cans of refried beans at the store.  Cans are, for me, much more of a pain in so many ways.  By the way, you can recycle these plastic bags, along with any others, at the plastic-bag recycle bin in most grocery stores.  I admit I haven't calculated whether the canned beans are cheaper, but I doubt it, since so much of the weight is water."
A2LSX649FXAYPM,B000FICDO8,Beans,Awesome Refrieds!,"I'm a refried bean aficionado and these are excellent. As others have said, they're infinitely better than canned. No offensive canned taste and the texture is smooth. Great in a tostada (a little lettuce, cheese, avo and salsa makes for a killer one), a burrito or as a side. With a little help, you can get them to taste just like a legit Mexican restaurant's. The trick is to get the right proportion of water to bean mix - go a little runny on the water, as they solidify while they're simmering and cooling. Along with this, all you need is a pinch of garlic powder, pepper and olive oil.<br /><br />For a Mexican food-loving vegetarian like myself, this product is a staple. High fiber, protein and flavor. I can make my own veggie burritos now that are just as good (almost anyway) as the taco shop."
A12Q26YMJ14ALY,B000FICDO8,Beans,SFB,product is excellent. only problem is that quantities come in small packing. Sisco gives the same product in big single packing.would advise the manf to give in big packing.
A2FFY3WQ5GY470,B000FICDO8,Beans,"Great price, easy to store",I like these beans. They are tasty and the price is great! I am not in LOVE with them though. But I do have a subscription for them and get them every 2 months.
A1ZBNHMPVDOH63,B000FICDO8,Beans,Santa Fe Instant Fat Free Refried Beans,"I have been purchasing this product for several years, originally from grocery stores and now through Amazon.com since I cannot find them in any local stores.  My family really enjoys them.  They are super easy to prepare and the packs are resealable which I love since I only need to make about half the bag for just myself and my husband."
A1KYE4PMM4GGZ8,B000FICDO8,Beans,easy peasy beans,"beans are delicious, and what could be easier .. just takes a few minutes, add some rice, and maybe a taco or enchilada, and dinner is served.  1 complaint .. price went up since my last order..what a shame !  all in all i'm sure i'll order again."
A3GL9RCI3FHH8K,B000FICDO8,Beans,Super mild beans means you can spice it the way you like,"I use dehydrated beans for both backpack camping and for my emergency rations (living in California, I think of it as preparation for the supposedly-overdue ""Big One"").  I've tried several vegi-beans and the reason I like these is because they're so mild, they can be spiced the way each person likes.  I used to buy spicy beans but it wasn't spicy enough for me, while others wanted them less salty/spicy.  Now I can take these beans and my super hot sauce and everybody's happy."
A250GBP3UC7082,B000FICDO8,Beans,"Great tasting, nutritional, and convenient!","Very pleased with these beans!  Extremely easy and quick to prepare, can adjust consistency to your liking.  These are very good as they come, but you can spice them up if you desire by just throwing in some green chilis, and/or cheese.  Much better tasting and cheaper than refrieds out of the can!"
A2M3MVCK0X9P4J,B000FICDO8,Beans,The Best,"I was a bit leery of theses but I am glad I ordered So good. Way  better than canned Im on a restricted diet no wheat dairy meat sugar .these  beans  will  permanent fixture in my diet. they are great with food should taste good, multi grain chips"
A2S2ZEROJTRQCU,B000FICDO8,Beans,Very good!,Refried beans you can take anywhere! Just add very hot water and let sit until soft - or boil in water for 5 minutes. Only ingredients: pinto beans and salt. My whole family loves these!
AQJC7LNUYE937,B000FICDO8,Beans,AUTHENTIC MEXICAN RESTAURANT QUALITY,"WOW! These refried beans and the black refried beans are sooooo good. I don't write many reviews, but with the quality of these beans, I just had to do so. Even better, they have only two ingredients: beans and salt!  That's just unheard of these days.  And, the salt content is just fine.  The instructions tell you to ""season to taste,"" so I thought salt might have been needed.  But, I cooked them according to directions, and they need nothing else.  They're perfect.  Oh, and did I mention they are so easy and quick to make!!!  These are definitely replacing my canned beans!"
A10HEUSXUSETQG,B000FICDO8,Beans,Delicious but salty,"These beans are delicious, but why the need for so much salt?  The company should offer a low-salt variety."
A27X750TSCLBD,B000FICDO8,Beans,fiberlicious,"I would probably die if i did not have these beans at all times. I make them almost every day. My family loves these beans, I use them in chili and quesadillas, with rice and fish they are just great, they go with everything. They are so easy to make!"
A39ZWNAI7NQN90,B000FICDO8,Beans,Santa Fe Bean Company,The first time I used this product I loved it.  Easy and quick to prepare with an excellent taste.  I prepared some seasoned steak tips and mix them with the Santa Fe beans.  It was great as a soup or poured over a baked potato with cheese. I plan to keep this product in my pantry.  An excellent food.
A1YNW0F6XQ996W,B000FICDO8,Beans,Too Much Salt,"Sorry to say the beans had way too much salt. They also had a burnt taste. Since they are not returnable, I am going to try mixing unsalted can beans with them. I am trying to find beans that taste like Taco Bell beans and these just weren't the ones."
A2CKJTLNXP40L3,B000LKTB90,Pasta,More corn than quinoa,"So I am giving this two stars, mainly because this product/brand tries to trick you into thinking it is quinoa-based spaghetti, even though the first ingredient listed is corn flour. Having more corn than quinoa in spaghetti is not quinoa-based, it is corn-based, though they put 'QUINOA' in big letters on the package and 'corn-quinoa' blend in small letters. Having a bunch of corn in the product basically negates the health benefits of this product."
A38B5ALZAMZY1A,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great gluten-free pasta!,Pasta has been one of the most difficult foods for me to give up; after finding out that I am allergic to wheat/rye/barley pasta.<br /><br />This pasta tastes fantastic and soothes my craving for a food I thought I had to give up!
A2D95KT35FSHE9,B000LKTB90,Pasta,delicious gluten free pasta,"I was so delighted to learn that I didn't have to give up pasta when I was diagnosed as celiac.  The quinoa pasta is very tasty and has a nice bite to it.  It has a smaller window of peak perfection when cooking.  If cooked too long it does get mushy and I find it tends to stick together.  A quick cool water rinse helps.<br /><br />We had tried rice pasta first.  It is pretty slick and tends to slide off your spoon.  We liked the taste in Pad thai, but not with Italian sauces."
A19IPLUIKG7Q3F,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great Pasta,"Tastes great, the whole family loves it. It has a corn taste unlike most pasta on the market. Great alternative to pasta's on the market if your looking for organic/natural foods."
A2TY1LWWR054SD,B000LKTB90,Pasta,"Really great tasting, textured and good-for-you pasta","I am not sensitive to gluten and I'm thankful for that.  My granddaughter and my dear friend are so I wanted to experiment with gluten free foods.  I did NOT like any of the rice pastas one bit.  A few years back, I ordered Bob's Red Mill organic quinoa flour and made the muffins on the package - everyone raved and there was no other flours in them so my deduction is that it's a broader spectrum flour to use for many things rather than all the mixes you have to concoct to make something baked that's gluten free - and really not be able to tell the difference. I decided I'd order this pasta and see what it's like.  I absolutely love it to the point its the only pasta I buy. It's just healthier all around...period. I have a parrot who totally loves pasta and this is a much better food for him, too.  Whatever I'm eating he has to be eating, too - he even ate liver and onions!  When I give him this pasta, he doesn't come up for air and repeats 'goooood' the whole time he's pigging out.  He wouldn't eat the rice pastas. I buy the Bertolli pasta sauces in the little bags (amazing pasta sauces!) and one bag is perfect for one box of quinoa pasta.  It reheats very, very well, it's good cold, tho! It's easy to over-cook but once you get it down, you'll find it cooks a little quicker than wheat pasta. I do not add oil to the water but I use a cooking chopstick to keep it moving just until each strand of pasta is all separated and good and wet and I have no problem with it sticking together through the rest of the cooking process.  I use the water to moisten my dog's dry food - she loves it, too.<br /><br />It's so plainly bannered on the packaging and in the product description that it's corn and quinoa pasta.  I can't believe someone down-rated the product because they didn't read what they were buying!"
A2IF5J75C7N3W1,B000LKTB90,Pasta,best non-gluten product,"So glad I tried this.  Thanks to the first 2 reviewers, I had confidence and am not disappointed.  Product is firm, not mealy and more nutritious then processed wheat.  I wasn't able to have spaghetti for the longest time.  Addendum 12/4/09: you do have to pay attention while cooking this; this pasta is not forgiving in being over-cooked; I have found that adding olive oil to the water before adding pasta helps to lessen sticking, although cooking shows may dispute that this works for regular pasta.  I am still buying this product."
A173S7PYTY6FPM,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Quinoa Pasta,"Ignore ANY negative reviews.  I've already had to give up bread, pastry, and just about everything else that tasted good when I gave up gluten.  This is HANDS DOWN the best gluten free pasta you can buy.  Even my wife and kids, only one of which also has a problem with gluten, likes this better than regular pasta.  It cooks like regular pasta and has better flavor than wheat products.  Yes, it has corn in it - so what?  It cooks easier and tastes better than the rice-based products.  If you can't eat gluten, this is your pasta and UDI's is your bread."
A3W566PWQ4S7J1,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Superior to rice,"I love this spaghetti. I have been hoping to find a pasta that can hold up well and also tastes very close to my once deeply missed semolina pastas.<br />This one wins hands down! I can even use it broken up into soups and it retains it's texture. (doesn't get mushy) I agree that it takes longer to cook, but it's worth it! Since it cooks slowly, I find it a snap to catch the al dente point. I was using Tinkyada pastas and I still will for lasagna, fettucini etc.. but this spaghetti wins hands down for texture, taste, everything. I agree that it should be noted that it is made from mostly corn (which is non-gmo) with quinoa (organic) as it's 2nd ingredient for those with corn sentivities.<br />My only complaint is that 8 oz packaging is a bummer. Coming from a long line of Italian chefs.. We really love our pasta, so I have to cook 3-4 boxes per meal. That gets pricey.<br /><br />Try this brand!! If you are just ok with the rice pastas, but still missing your old pasta texture and flavor.. you'll truly appreciate this!<br />My family and I are thrilled to have found this!!!"
A3G0ZE5NEH8L8L,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Noodle over this gluten-free winner!,"When I went gluten-free to manage chronic pain, one of the biggest cravings I fought was for pasta.  I tried lots of gluten-free varieties including brown rice pasta, corn pasta, and quinoa pasta and Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta is a clear winner!  Cooks up perfectly al dente (as long as you time it--more below on that) and doesn't get mushy.  Flavor is closest to wheat-based or flour-based pastas and is mild enough to work with any type of italian or other sauce.  Firm enough to manage the biggest meatballs when tossing.  Bakes well for casseroles.  Keeps shape and flavor when refrigerated as a cold pasta dish.  I've tried all different forms and find them all to be consistently great!<br /><br />Downsides?  8 oz boxes is really only 2 servings and small servings at that.  Really need to follow timing suggestions.  I time it at 8 min boiling and then check often until al dente."
A2JCGSIIQ96RKA,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Best GF Pasta by a mile,My non-GF family members eat this and love it.  It is the only GF pasta that doesn't taste like it.  I have tried all the pastas and this far suprasses them all. Plus it has lots of protein.
A2IW1L47TLKA5A,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Bad,This is not quinoa pasta it is corn pasta. It makes a very nasty mess of corn starchy water when cooked. Do not fall for it!
ARAEKW4OEPI7O,B000LKTB90,Pasta,not what I expected,"I was very disappointed that it was not clear from the label that this<br />quinoa product is actually corn and quinoa.  I cannot eat corn.  There is<br />enough corn in it that it should be called quinoa-corn pasta.<br />I usually read the labels very closely, but I missed this ingredient.  I<br />guess because I know there quinoa cereal is just quinoa.  So I have a stack<br />of food I can't eat.<br />Lots of people who look for quinoa are gluten intolerant.  Corn sensitivity<br />is also very common.  I hope they'll make their label more clear."
AHO3GZPAGYD5N,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Corn is first ingredient,Like another reviewer I did not realize until I got this that is was corn based. Very misleading and disappointing. I will look to other brand names that are reliable and truthful.
ASAHTTUEJSUN2,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Good alternative to wheat pasta unless you're on a tight budget,"This gets three stars from me because of the packet size vs value for money - it contains perhaps 2 (not-that-hungry female) portions and for the price I find that almost unacceptable.  Also, if you have been told you are gluten intolerant or have decided that gluten is not a healthy food choice and really miss spaghetti with your favourite sauce, then be prepared to have your taste buds challenged slightly.<br /><br />As with anything, it does take a little bit of getting used to and you do have to watch for the 8 - minute cooking time mark and then test often to catch the 'al dente' stage, or the pasta will become claggy/sticky.  The texture is good although you will of course notice the difference between this and regular spaghetti.  I found this product retained heat for longer than standard pasta, which was a nice surprise.<br /><br />Due to the cost, I have decided to use this product for light lunches rather than cook a lot of the packet for a decent-sized dinner, and rendering the amount left for another serving unbalanced, i.e not enough for a portion. Complaints aside, this is the best alternative to wheat pasta that I have tried so far in terms of taste and texture and performance at ""holding"" a sauce.  Due to the price of this product, I will only be repurchasing a few times a year but I do recommend it if you're not worried about blowing your budget."
A3LD7NUA0UAPFW,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Why the increase?,"We love this product, but were shocked to discover nearly a $10 increase in price today!  Why the sharp increase?"
AAEW50UKXP9Q0,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Love this stuff,"I love this quinoa corn pasta.  I think I have a mild wheat allergy, because I feel better when I don't eat it.  Luckily, I like this pasta more than wheat pasta and certainly more than rice.  It's good in cold salads as well as hot spaghetti with sauce.  I like that it is NON-GMO too."
APT4EDFQRX9OE,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Amazing gluten-free pasta,"I love, love, love this pasta. I actually prefer it over wheat! I've tried every brand of brown rice pasta and was disgusted my the mushiness of it. This pasta is ""aldente"" and it doesn't turn the water you boil it in milky. Highly recommend!!!"
A11IXJ8M1JO296,B000LKTB90,Pasta,The best GF pasta!,"We've tried them all in the almost 20 years since my husband was diagnosed with Celiac Disease. This quinoa is the absolute best pasta, closest to semolina types. I love it too and I don't have to avoid wheat. The price is great here and Publix has been out of it for awhile. Great to know Amazon has it."
A19Y07HCANKHJ3,B000LKTB90,Pasta,delicious,I have tried many gluten free pastas and his one is the best I have found! it is a combination of rice and quinoa flour. tastes very similar to wheat pasta!
A6KWQKOHSFYQC,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Best gluten free pasta,"It comes out with a better bite than real al dente pasta, at least in my opinion. It tastes good, and cooks up consistently. I tried every brand I could find, and unfortunately most of them couldn't be cooked to a point where they had a bite remotely resembling cooked or overcooked."
A1DOD6DF3P6KKG,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Wonderful gluten-free pasta,This is what I consider to be the best tasting gluten-free pasta out there.  I have never liked the rice pastas because the texture is not quite right.  This pasta is wonderful because you can cook and cook it and it does not seem to get overdone.  Just rinse it in hot water when you're done cooking it and enjoy!
A2SV3NV5QAK3MO,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Healthy and very delicious!,"I can't eat spaghetti with gluten, and this spaghetti fits what I'm looking for. It has organic corn and most importantly has quinoa in it which is a complete protein. I add a spaghetti sauce with veggies, as well as some Romano cheese, extra garlic powder and olive oil. Simply heavenly! The price for this product at Amazon is always discounted for which I am grateful."
A21QER6QW9T2ME,B000LKTB90,Pasta,good alternative,"After having found how versatile quinoa is as a grain and because niether of us likes the whole grain pastas we've found, we began looking for a quinoa pasta.  We were very pleased to find this product in bulk online; and, although, we don't eat pasta often these days, we already are on our second carton of 12 boxes."
A2WR25EFB5LBT9,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Is that all?,"The noodles were great--both kids liked them!--and I was very happy with the price until I realized that I was going through this pasta twice as fast as the organic wheat, at twice the price.  So if you don't mind paying a lot more for quinoa, it's a great product.  Check the weight of the box and judge for yourself."

A1XU9AYF0JK2FV,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Very healthy,"IN RE to complaint below:  There is corn flour in the product because it is impossible to form a pasta noodle from quinoa alone--because quinoa lacks the starch to hold the particles together.  At least one reviewer is confusing corn flour with corn fructose syrup i would imagine.  There is no particular health threat from consuming some corn or corn flour.  Corn flour is used as a substitute binder for wheat flour--which contains gluten.  If you are wheat, celiac or IBS, or gluten sensitive, or diabetic--this product can really improve the quality of your life.<br /><br />If you are a diabetic -- you still need to watch your portion (of this pasta) carefully.  We find 2 oz (dry) pasta to be about the max serving reasonable.<br /><br />Eating Quinoa regularly can be very beneficial.  We eat quinoa daily now.  We generally eat whole grain (not flour) quinoa--we usually mix 1/2 white, 1/4 red, 1/4 black (washed 3 times whether it comes prewashed or not, then cooked in ample water (13 min for the mixture--less for all white) and drained rather than the measured portion of water many recipes cite.  We buy 10 pound bags or red and black through Amazon and 25 pound bags of white from Bob's red mill--freeze surplus).  This pasta adds a little variety to our lives and we find that it is delicious.<br /><br />It requires a little gentleness when cooked but is a rather easy meal. Add a little olive oil, bring water to boil, stir in pasta, turn down heat to simmer 10 minutes and then longer until tender."
A1ECGR262KIVXV,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Best gluten free pasta out there,"I've ben gluten free for a while now and think this pasta is wonderful (even better than fresh gluten free pasta I've had). Corn is the first ingredient, so if you're allergic to corn it's not for you. Otherwise, you'll no longer feel like you're missing out on pasta with this stuff. It's as good as the real thing."
AVSM9CBFS8945,B000LKTB90,Pasta,My Favorite Gluten-Free Pasta,"I've tried a number of rice, corn, and other wheat free pastas. This is by far my favorite. Cooked according to directions it is the only one that has a similar taste and texture to regular semolina wheat pasta. Reheated the texture changes so don't extra."
A1WZ1OXI201KRL,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Even non-Celiacs love it!,"I have to eat gluten-free to stay healthy, but the rest of my family doesn't.  My boyfriend of many years, actually asks for this pasta and really enjoys it.  And, we've found that this pasta cooks almost exactly the same as regular pasta, but for any recipe that uses the ""pasta water"" as an ingredient, this pasta actually makes a really good pasta water and the end product is PERFECT.  (Using pasta water incorporates some of the liquid and primarily the starches that boil off of the pasta into the sauce you are making).  We love this pasta and eat it at least once a week, if not more.  This is my preferred brand of gluten-free pasta."
A6BZUK06HSSCM,B000LKTB90,Pasta,The best gluten free noodles ever tasted!!,"Quinoa spaghetti noodles have good, palatable texture...not pasty, and wheatless!  A miraculous product for those who love spaghetti and have become gluten intolerant!!"
A2R7LPK0UQMQII,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great product,"this is delicious and gluten free!!!!!!<br />That is great at meeting the needs of my family. It tastes great and not chalky like other gluten-free pasta!!!<br />I love this product and so does my family,"
A2HRJMGPNEF3DF,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Excellent product,"My husband does not eat wheat products; however, we love spaghetti dishes.  I bought a couple of boxes of quinoa spaghetti locally and we both like it even better than wheat based spaghetti.  I ordered a case of the spaghetti and it arrived promptly.  Now, I would not use any other type of spaghetti."
A1SR8UP4GL8SCE,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Best Spaghetti I've had,I've tried several different GF spaghetti's or noodles as substitutes but this is the 1st pasta that I have found that is both very tasty & just as good a day later warmed up from the fridge. Every rice pasta that I have used is always disgusting the next day or even hours later.
AO8GDFL2AI5CA,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Our Favorite Gluten and Wheat Free Pasta,"I've tried several wheat free/ gluten free pastas, and this is my absolute favorite.  I think the main problem with wheat free-pastas is their texture.  This comes out al dente every time!  I've also noticed that the water (after cooking) is less starchy than the brown-rice pasta that we use sometimes.  Aside from the spaghetti, we've also tried the veggie curls--another favorite by this brand.  With this type of pasta--especially the spaghetti--I recommend stirring it frequently during cooking or the pasta might come out stuck together."
A17FS6MKOP70EG,B000LKTB90,Pasta,LOVE this product!,"After being diagnosed with a gluten intolerance in October, my first concern was finding a good replacement for pasta, which my husband and I both love. Even though I found one that was really good, it still had a taste and consistency different that regular pasta.  But after seeing all the positive reviews, I thought I'd try this brand and can't believe how close it comes to the real thing. Delicious!  Even my husband says not to bother cooking him regular pasta anymore...this is so good, he'll just eat this with me.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it only comes in an 8-oz box. For us, it's fine since there's only two of us but my son and grandson also need to eat gluten-free and they try to cook that way for their family of six. They would have to use three boxes to cook up enough.  But the taste is so worth it!"
A2DM3395C6ZUTL,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great Gluten Free Alternative,For those who love pasta but are allergic to gluten this is a wonderful alternative.  We've tried all the rice flour options and found them to be soggy and tasteless.  This product has taste and texture.
A3TNUG1UWOGCK4,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Just like wheat pasta,"I use this pasta at least once a week for spaghetti and it cooks and tastes just like wheat-based pastas. Some gluten-free pastas tend to get gummy or stay chewy after boiling, but this one cooks like the 'real' thing. I actually buy many of this brand's products and recommend them highly."
A3A9I8J593L56S,B000LKTB90,Pasta,best gluten free pasta,"I have tried  many gluten free products, and found this brand to be the best.  It is most like non gluten free pasta."
AK7EEVH3ZLJR9,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Healthy is delicious!,"As we try to gently move to healthier choices, I have NEVER been able to sell my children on whole grain pasta. On an impulse I picked this up at the Whole Foods last week -- and they devoured it. They even like it better than regular white flour pasta! I can make an inexpensive, nutritious meal my children will actually eat? Awesomeness squared."
A2QROC8KCX31B4,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great Taste... but Advise CAUTION,"I love the taste and texture of this pasta (as long as you pay attention to cooking instructions mentioned in the other reviews).<br />HOWEVER, I always experience joint pain after eating it. I can eat quinoa with no problems, so my problem must be with the corn. Since my reaction is no where near as severe as with wheat, I do eat this on occasion.<br /><br />So, my ""caution"" is that you listen to YOUR body, and if you notice any unpleasant effects, just don't eat this very often.<br /><br />btw... if you are testing yourself for gluten sensitivity, it's best to go off ALL grains for at least a month (really, it won't kill you!).  Then, add some of the less offensive ones, such as quinoa, back into your diet, one at a time. Note how you feel the next day.  Then, use common sense, and don't eat the ones that cause you pain or discomfort."
A1J9QKCK8V3QKM,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great gluten free pasta!,"After trying a white rice pasta, I thought I'd have to swear off eating pasta, as it was terrible.  It is difficult to find a wheat free pasta locally, so I thought I'd read the reviews on Amazon for the different pastas. After seeing so many positive reviews, I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm glad that I did!<br />I agree with the other reviews that like this pasta. It has a great texture, much like the ""regular"" wheat pasta. It also has a pleasant taste. I don't think it especially tastes like corn or quinoa, but has a flavor very similar to the popular wheat pasta. I think this may be a product that I order regularly in the future."
A1BBPP1EC75JX4,B000LKTB90,Pasta,"excellent gluten-free spaghetti: great taste, great structure","I was very careful not to overcook this pasta, making sure to take a bite every minute or so, and rinsed it with water as soon as it was al dente. It was all very easy and the result was absolutely *PERFECT*. This is one great tasting gluten-free pasta! My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite ""grains""), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease."
A9M022DZLXYFP,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great alternative pasta,"This was excellent tasting pasta.  I wanted an alternative to whole-wheat pasta, which I do not care for, and this was far better than I hoped.  I like this as much as regular white pasta.  It has a great taste and nice texture. I will be buying it again.<br /><br />It is not hard to cook.  I boil the water.  I use less water than the box recommends because my favorite pasta pan is smaller.  I put enough to cover it at least an inch and a half.  I add a bit of salt, about a teaspoon (less for pesto and more for some tomato recipes).  When the water boils, I add a splash of olive oil and the pasta.  I boil it 8 minutes. Add sauce of choice."
A2XDM9JIYGUGFN,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great Gluten Free Spaghetti,"This gluten free spaghetti is the best of the gluten free pastas I've tried.  It tastes better than regular spaghetti and has a good texture.  It is not so high in fiber (like some of the rice pastas) that it would set off someone's sensitive digestive systems, which is a relief to me!  I like it so much that I would buy it on subscribe and save.  It is hard to buy in the store in the area where I live and so convenient to have delivered at such a reasonable price right to my home."
ANUEIQBZQFNVE,B000LKTB90,Pasta,A Grateful Celiac,"I am a recently diagnosed celiac, and not having wheat is a challenge.  My first experience of spaghetti sauce on rice noodles was awful.  Rice noodles are extremely bland.  However, this pasta is AWESOME!!!!!  My family tried it too, and can hardly tell the difference from regular wheat pasta. They will gladly eat this pasta with me.  I am a pasta lover, so the celiac diet has been a tough one.  Now I will be able to once again enjoy the pasta dishes I love without making my family suffer through eating rice noodles."
A1BNUYVLSH6PBE,B000LKTB90,Pasta,NIce but kind of pricy,"I have found that if you use the amount of water that the box recommends to cook it in, that it does not stick as others have stated. Really excellent pasta. This sight has the best price! I like this Gluten free pasta. It has pretty good texture, not mealy and no after taste like some of the other brands."
AET2BRH3JRW7J,B000LKTB90,Pasta,This used to be my favorite,"After being diagnosed with Celiacs disease, I had a heck of a time finding a gluten free pasta that I liked.  When I found this quinoa pasta at Whole Foods, it became my favorite.  Once you figure out the right cooking time, it won't disappoint. We are in Albuquerque (high altitude)so it takes exactly nine minutes to perfect aldente. It has a nice flavor, but lets face it - once you get the texture right -  pasta is really about the sauce anyway. The noodles are a little on the thin side, which is why I say it used to be my favorite:  I have since found Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti with Rice Bran - My new favorite. The noodles are thicker like wheat spaghetti. And they have the perfect texture and flavor when cooked properly. But that's a different review... I love the Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta, Spaghetti Style and their macaroni product makes great macaroni and cheese and pasta salad. But that too is a different review..."
A25ETVRL1LE4LN,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Delicious!,"I love this Gluten free pasta. Great texture, not mealy and no after taste like some of the other brands. I have found that if you use the amount of water that the box recommends to cook it in, that it does not stick as others have stated.<br />Really excellent pasta. Amazon.com has the best price!"
A3I5YPJZMTG1QO,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great flavor--now I can include pasta in my eating plan again.,"I've been eating low carb for almost two years and had been serving my family a LC pasta (Dreamfields).  Then recently I was diagnosed gluten & casein sensitive so that pasta was out.  After trying a box of this from my local natural foods market my husband declared he absolutely LOVED the taste.  So I ordered it from Amazon for a better price and stocked up my pantry.  I still alternate for myself between this and spiral-sliced zucchini (made with the World Cuisine Spiral Slicer I bought on Amazon--see my review on that).<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, you definitely have to time it just right; don't overcook it or you will be disappointed.  Otherwise, great pasta!"
A3S1LHDKWADMNW,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Exceptionally good!,"Since I am gluten intolerant, I have really missed good pasta. This Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta, Spaghetti Style is the closest you can come to the real thing. You do have to be careful not to over or under cook it. Overcook and it will be mushy, under cook and it will be too tough and clumpy. But you will learn to test it and get it right every time and oh, it is SO worth it! My family doesn't even know they aren't eating ""regular"" pasta.<br />Every variety of the Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta is exceptionally good. I asked them why they don't manufacture a lasagna noodle. They did try, but the breakage of the noodle made the packaging costs too high.<br />I highly recommend this pasta!"
AMZ6MQCOJF67T,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Great Texture!,"I recently discovered I have an issue with gluten (migraines, etc).  I have tried brown rice pasta and been very disappointing.  Even the one that says ""not mushy"" on the package.  I think that it is either undercooked or mushy.  The first time I tried quinoa pasta, I was a little turned off by the yellow color of the pasta until I tried it.  It tastes just like regular pasta.  I am so happy to finally find an alternative to pasta!!!"
A16PDGD4ELI9QF,B000LKTB90,Pasta,The BEST alternative pasta,"I have tried whole wheat pasta and it sat like lead in my stomach! Ugh!! I found brown rice pasta and thought that was better. But by far the best alternative is the Quinoa pasta. I served it to one of my ""pasta snob"" friends, and she loved it!!! Enough said."
A102UXGLDF76G1,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Should say Corn & Quinoa,"I should have looked at the ingredients! I thought I was ordering quinoa (only) pasta, but when I got it the largest ingredient is corn. The front of the package does not say anything about corn, so I was quite disappointed when I got a whole case of it. Plus, I ordered other quinoa pasta the same day from them too and it has the same break down on ingredients.<br /><br />It is probably not fair to give them such a low grade since it was my error for not looking at the ingredients, but I think their packaging is misleading.<br /><br />I read a bunch of reviews and people sure seemed to love it, but I have to stay away from corn and wheat or I feel awful so I never tried it."
A23Q4B6O6E8GZ9,B000LKTB90,Pasta,Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta,"recently i was diagnosed as having sensitivites to wheat, barley, etc.  i am also sensitive to corn.<br /><br />while i applaud ancient harvest for having this product, i think it is a misnomer to label it as gluten-free - since many people who have sensitivities to gluten products ALSO have sensitivites to corn.<br /><br />i did try this product earlier this year and had a problem with the 'corn' part."
A2IHOUK31N323P,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Disgusting,I know they were trying because most of their other products are good. But this tasted awful. I'd rather just stick to the real thing with this.
A1VJQ5A72CVWTD,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY,ABSOLUTELY  the worst peanutbutter i've ever tasted! Dont waist your money!this product is worse than dog food! and the smell is even worse!
A3GAMRRHU5N36L,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Disgusting,Excrement mixed with splenda is the best way I can describe this. Its awful. Why not mix a little bit of fat in there to make it edible?
A2IIMX1CS0TIE9,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"The ""Yucks"" had it right!","With all the bad reviews, I still wanted to see for myself if this product was in any way passable for a peanut butter replacement, having shed 170lbs with a bit more still to go, I'm constantly looking for ways to eat things I like with as little calories as possible. Well I loves me some peanut butter, but with my new healthy way of eating, it's pretty much absent from my diet these days, even as a very rare treat. With that in mind, I figured what the heck, I'll give this a shot. Boy should I have heeded all the other posters advice! I'm pretty open minded about alternative or food substitutes, but this stuff, well ""YUCK"" is the word!<br />When I got it, along with several other Walden products I ordered from their site, it was the first thing I wanted to try. When I opened the jar it did have the look of PB so I was hopeful, maybe this WOULD be okay. It wasn't. The first taste was sickeningly sweet, almost didn't go back for a second one, but had to to see if what I tasted was right. Next bite was like an entirely different product. This time there wasn't a super sweet taste, more like metallic or something. After that I thought ""oh boy"" I think I just blew nearly $50 bucks on this stuff (all the Walden products I had ordered). In fairness I did try pairing it up with other things, since I'd read on here that others advise not eating it on it's own. So at first I tried a PB&J. It was just as bad. I tried with fruit. I tried mixing it with PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack as someone else here suggested (which btw is a peanut butter replacement I do highly recommend). I tried it after I chilled it in the fridge and heated up in the microwave. I kept waiting for any semblance of a peanut flavor, but it never came. And so rather than leave it sitting in my fridge for the next several months, which it would have been as it was never going to get used, I threw it away. It wasn't easy, firstly there was all the money I spent because I not only threw out the Peanut spread, I also tossed the grape and raspberry jams I couldn't stand either. But it was also that I WANTED to have liked this enough to eat it.<br /><br />I will say out of the products I've sampled so far from Walden, I have yet to try the mayo, ketchup, and bacon ranch dressings I bought, I found at least some of them were okay. I'd say the best so far is the chocolate dip. It's nothing like the consistency of melted chocolate, more like a chocolate pudding. But at least it was edible. The French onion dip wasn't too bad either. Thousand Island dressing wasn't all that great, but I'll at least finish the bottle. I also don't really care for the caramel sauce which I did have higher hopes for after the reviews it got.<br /><br />Again, I spent quite a bit on this, and it was pretty much money wasted, as I didn't discover a great new product and won't be buying any of this stuff again. But it hasn't soured me on still trying low calorie alternatives to broaden my diet. I just will probably steer clear of the fake foods, since with tastes like this, the best way to have zero calories in your foods, is to just not have them."
A35WYW1ZSUVKYG,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Truly revolting,"Imagine farmers on earth lose the ability to grow peanuts. And, 10000 years down the road, an alien species who never tasted peanut butter before tries to whip up a batch. I am sure the result would be something like Walden Farms Peanut Spread.<br /><br />It's not very peanuty, not very buttery...it's just the vaguest notion of peanut taste in a very foul paste-like consistency. The after taste is thoroughly horrible, with notes of shredded hubcaps and melted imitation Reeboks from Laos.<br /><br />If you are a dieter and are trying to incorporate some fun alternatives into your eating plan, skip this one. It's truly revolting."
A2MY6AU7KT64X5,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Wow - Dissapointment,"This came as a surprise to me because I have enjoyed many other WF products. However, the texture and smell of this peanut spread (not peanut butter!!) is gross. Slimy, thin and tastes like it contains sugar alcohols. Not pleasant. I can imagine mixing it into a recipe to hide the odd texture (it might be good in peanut butter cookies) but otherwise, skip it."
A3D0A2ELY0VPUU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,IMHO nasty-tasting,"Being an avid peanut butter lover, I chose this product with enthusiasm, which was short-lived. IMHO this product has an annoyingly cloying sweet flavor and no peanut butter flavor whatosever. I threw it in the trash after one taste."
A2H8UV4UALLTQH,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Creativity helps make this really worth while,"OK, so I ordered this without any idea of how it would work. And I have learned a few things about what does work and what doesn't. First, put it in the refrigerator! That is the only way the consistency works. Otherwise, it has a very strange texture. But directly from the refrigerator it is a lot more like the consistency of regular peanut butter.<br /><br />Second, don't expect it to taste like peanut butter! It is a peanut spread - without any calories! I don't know how they do that, but peanuts have calories so this is something else. I tried it with some Walden Farms jelly and I must say it was one of the more unpleasant food experiences I have had. However, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are not the only use for peanut flavored foods!<br /><br />So I made a peanut satay sauce with it! Added some lime juice, some curry powder, some Braggs (soy sauce equivalent) and some Walden Farms pancake syrup for sweetener (best way to use that is to sweeten other things you are cooking). Heated it all up and served it over roasted chicken for my meat-eating friends and over tofu for the vegetarians. They all raved about it!<br /><br />So I will be ordering this again! Because I have more recipes that call for peanut flavor and this is the best way I know to add it to my cooking without adding all the related fat and excess calories!"
A2O78F2WGVJ19M,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Disgusting!,Most disgusting stuff ever. Most of the other WF products are ok (except mayo) but the Peanut Butter is not. Dont waste your money.
A3SJ01U6Y6OK1D,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Walden Farms Peanut Spread,"When I first opened the jar it smelled like some chemical, not peanuts.  I got past that and tried some and it was disgusting.  I had to eat something else just to get the taste out of my mouth. I tried mixing it with PB2 as another  review mentioned, all that did was waste PB2.  This was a complete waste of money since I wouldn't even mix this with other food."
ADV8E3ID5QSTF,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,GROSS!,"First impression is that it is very runny. Infact, some splashed on the floor when I opened the jar. I called the dog over to lick it up and he turned his nose up to it. This is a dog that eats anything. Should have known that was a bad sign. The only way I can describe it is that it taste like chemicals. Total waste of money!"
A33MSZ57UM8VTA,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Why did I think this was a good idea?,I bought some last week and I thought it was retched! I tried mixing it around in my mouth for a few minutes and it was horrible. for the rest of the weekend I could not get the flavor out of my mouth.
AMXWEKJL9PF1J,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,YIKES!  Horrible....,"Other Walden Farms products are great, but this one is disgusting!  I couldn't get past a tiny taste.  My husband (who will eat ANYTHING) thought it was nasty and wouldn't eat it.  To the trash bin this goes!  Save yourself!  Do not buy this product!  Blech!"
A2ZL7OS8XCB6U8,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Get real peanut butter,"I dont know why, but I had a feeling this would taste like crap when I first looked at it.  But I got it anyways.  Instead of cutting corners with peanut butter, splurge your calories on the real stuff.  This is the worst peanut butter ever."
A1XVQ3KHS22E3F,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,peanut butter,product looks good and smells good.  I wish I could say the same about taste.  perhaps mixed with other ingredients ie for no bake cookies.  but as far as peanut butter sandwiches I will pass.  I TRIED IT WITH THE NO BAKE COOKIES AND IT WAS AWFUL.  ENDED UP THROWING THE BEST PART OF THE JAR AWAY. I WAISTED MY MONEY.
A3KLJRSRRUNA1P,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Completely horrible, couldn't even swallow","I bought this because I am always looking for a healthy peanut butter substitute. Wow, what a mistake that was. It was by far the worst thing I've ever attempted to eat. I didn't even swallow, spit it out in the trash can. I do eat a fair amount of diet foods, so it's not like I was expecting it to taste like regular Jif, I had realistic expectations considering the nutrition facts. The consistantcy was way off. It was more like a Cool Whip type consistancy. The taste was not remotely peanutty. It smelled like oil based paint. Sorry Walden Farms, you failed on this one. I'm back to reduced fat Jif now and its the best nutritionally as far as the decent tasting peanut butters go. I really like Crazy Richards too, less sugar but a little more fat. But this stuff was nasty, seriously, just don't buy it."
A2VWKIG9HC309P,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Wasting my money never tasted so bad.,"I bought this from a local health food store.  I am a runner taking some down time and therefore trying to cut calories.  Thought that perhaps, even if it were not very flavorful, this could be made to work.  Even if it were just pleasant tasting overall, you can add a teeny bit of honey or splenda or something to make it work, and as a seasoned dieter/calorie cutter, there's not much I can't make work.<br />The stuff has a gel-consistency, like several other Walden Farms products I have tried.  I put a small spoon of it in my mouth to try it out and INSTANTLY threw it in the garbage.  A $3 product.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter, or peanuts, or some imitation of either.  It's hard to describe what it tasted like.  Maybe if someone took Vaseline and put something really bitter in it along with some chemicals so there would be a long lasting aftertaste.  It was slightly salty, but mostly it made me feel like I was attempting to eat something not made for human consumption.  If you are able to put this in your mouth and not spit it out, you don't have tastebuds.<br />If you're desperate for PB as a dieter, try one of 3 things:<br />1. PB2 is apparently popular.<br />2. I used to enjoy Better N' Butter, but I'm not sure if they make it anymore.  It IS available on Amazon.  Not the same, slightly syrupy sweet, but OK.<br />3. Take a lowfat PB and cut it with something lower calorie such as sugar free jelly or sugar free pancake syrup.<br />Just whatever you do, don't try this mess."
AM0ALNK6K349Y,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Revolting,"I understand that certain products in no-sugar form can often have a different taste and/or texture.  There is no excuse for this.  Gross beyond all measure.  On the upside, it made me not want to eat ANY peanut spread/butter for a while, so it did indirectly cut down on peanut butter calories/carbs!"
A3A04KTCC5AOMH,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Ickkkkk....,"Ew.. I don't know what I was eating, but it sure isn't peanut butter... Weird consistency and flavor... I'm just going to mix it with fluff so it makes it at least somewhat peanut butter-y and dulls the weird taste. Do NOT expect peanut butter from this prouduct. It is just a poor attempt at a duplicate."
A3FEF0TJFKQBRV,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Walden Farms is disappointing!,"Walden Farms Products are nasty, tasteless and always have weird textures. Nothing they make even remotely resembles anything that they're trying to re-create in a ZERO carb, calorie, sugar form. I have tried many many types of Walden Farms products and have not found ONE that didn't make me cringe after I tasted it. BUT, if you HAVE TO EAT THIS STUFF BECAUSE OF A MEDICAL CONDITION (like diabetes), then you may get accustom to it. I just wanted a zero/low calorie alternative to my everyday items and was sadly displeased with the products."
AU8GZDK6KHXCW,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,This stuff is HORRID!!!,This stuff is horrid!!! I will not buy this stuff again. The only one I would give this stuff to is the DEVIL!!!<br />You buy this stuff at your own risk.
ANMA1H8LGEVBF,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"I'm pretty tolerant w/ fat free substitutes, but I couldn't stomach this stuff....","Like the title says, I'm fairly tolerant of low/no fat substitute foods....I don't expect them to taste nearly as good as the original, but imho, this was SO bad, I actually ended up throwing the jar away (which I normally NEVER do with food unless it spoils....). I can't even begin to describe the taste...it was beyond chemical-tasting. I really enjoy the ""Better n Peanut Butter"" brand of low fat peanut butter.  Although it needs to be kept refrigerated (or else it can get moldy in a few weeks after it is opened), it is fairly close to the original in both texture and taste."
A3IJUJ5OIZ7Q3Y,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,A Good PB Substitute for Special Diets,"Please note that his is not peanut butter; it is peanut flavored spread. The consistency is that of a peanut butter flavored ice cream topping.  Of course the consistency and taste are not just like peanut butter, which is loaded with fat and calories. If you have special diet needs and cannot have peanut butter, this is a decent peanutty tasting substitute. I used to consume peanut butter every day without fail. When I had to remove it from diet over a year ago it was very difficult.  This product really helps to fill the PB craving."
A1IIPBH2CW24I,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,N-a-s-t-y,"Sorry guys, but wake up to realization. There can't be a yummy zero-calorie peanut butter spread out there. And this peanut butter just proves it. I was super excited when I found out that there is a zero-calorie peanut butter. When I bought it, I didn't want to admit that I hated it. I tried to eat it but I ended up giving it away. It is the nastiest thing in the world. First of all, when you open it you can see all the nasty oil excess at the top which just ruins your temptation of having this peanut butter. I hate the texture, it feels 100001% FAKE, It feels like melted gooey plastic in your mouth, and it tastes like a blob of yuck."
A25OB2R1S95HH5,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Yuck.,"I'm not typically a choosy eater, and I like the Walden Farms calorie free salad dressings, so I thought I'd give this stuff a whirl. It is vile. The texture is gross, and it left this awful after-taste in my mouth which I had a hard time getting rid of. Not good."
A521VQI1AT8OK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Good and tasty if you want zero calories,"UPDATE: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT.<br />The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).<br /><br />""I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our ""XXXX"".  Please send a proof of purchase, a note with the expiration date of the product and an explanation as to why you were not satisfied to the address below and we will gladly refund your money.  Thank you and again, my apologies.""<br /><br />Walden Farms<br />1209 W St Georges Ave<br />Linden, NJ 07036<br /><br />I spread this on Wasa sourdough crisp as part of an HCG Very Low Calorie diet. I thought it was tasty..and very peanut-like for ZERO CALORIES. It is thin. Goes well with Walden Farms blueberry fruit spread.<br /><br />NOW if you are NOT looking for ZERO calories..look elsewhere. If you can spare a few calories try PB2...it is a powdered peanut butter with fat removed. (I have not tried it..but I expect it will be better...when I get to phase 3...I'll try it).  But right now I'm on a low complex carb, low carb, Very low calorie and no sugar diet. THIS is not a lifestyle change diet..it is a rapid weight loss diet.....then you slowly introduce carbs, a little sugar and flavor.<br /><br />Walden farms fits in HCG diet Phase 2, when you are restricted to 500 calories  a day. (Some HCG folks allow 600-800 calories).<br /><br />IN a very low calorie diet phase..Walden Farms products are great.  BUT TRUST me..don't even think about Walden farms ZERO calorie products unless you are on an extreme diet....<br /><br />I don't think I'd enjoy the sourdough crisps without something..so I view the Walden farms spreads as a nice treat. If you are on a HCG diet, buy it.<br /><br />Just found a recipe. 1 T. peanut butter. 2 T.  ground flax seed and 1/4 cup water (or splurge and replace some water with zero calorie vanilla, butterscotch or caramel flavoring). Heat water to boiling & pour over flax seed & ""peanut butter"". 75 calories.<br />Some eat this as a ""cereal"". I cut up apples and used as a dip.  It was actually more than I wanted for one apple. You can half the recipe.<br /><br />Hope this helps folks."
A394R9ZLCSRFZO,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,CAN'T WIN THEM ALLI,"I am an avid farm of Walden Farms products. Virtually calorie free, fat free and sugar free, many of the dressings, syrups and sauces are extremely palatable. The caramel dessert dip is quite satisfying; the chocolate version is not bad. But if you are looking for a peanut butter alternative, this peanut spread is a surprising catastrophe. We could take the thin & fluffy texture, but the taste seems truly unpleasant. Another reviewer mentioned a chemical taste; I agree. One wonders who the tasters were in the kitchen.<br /><br />Walden Farms chefs---you can't win 'em all; take this product out of the line. It embarasses a truly innovative line of healthier products."
ABJELJYMDTFSY,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,I really tried...,"I very much wanted to like this peanut butter spread, but a positive attitude wasn't enough to overcome the many negatives of this product. I'd read the reviews and decided to bite the bullet and buy a jar. Product arrived okay and on time, but the aroma was industrial, the texture was oily and the taste was completely unacceptable. I tried it straight from the jar with a spoon and disliked it immediately. I did refrigerate it to try it the next day, giving the spread the benefit of a doubt that my ""taster"" was off. Tried it the next day and didn't eat a whole spoon full before I capped it, trashed it and considered the experience a lesson learned. To be fair, I've enjoyed other Walden Farms products, salad dressings, chocolate syrup and their spicy BBQ sauce are all fine. They just need to go back to the kitchen on this one."
A8YEJ366FMHAZ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Calorie Free Peanut Butter,"This calorie-free, fat free, gluten free, etc. peanut butter is not a very good substitute for the real thing. It tastes nothing like peanut butter and has a very strange consistency. It separates in between uses and gets really watery on top. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a great tasting peanut butter and jelly sandwich."
ADJQ6UAYJLVJH,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not so good,We have tried both Walden Farms Peanut Butter and Bettern' Peanut Butter. Bettern' Peanut Butter is much better. Walden Farms has an odd texture to it that's nothing like peanut butter.
A3T4Q576SC8YIT,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,YUCK,I was SO excited to discover this product at the local grocery store. I was willing to deal with the outrageous price for zero calorie peanut butter.<br /><br />HORRIBLY disappointed.<br /><br />The flavor is like licking a rusty metal object.
A1T2T7QGS4A5Q4,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Is this really food???,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1Q1G8"">Walden Farms - Creamy Peanut Spread (Calorie-Free, Carb-Free, Fat-Free, Sugar-Free) - 12-oz. Jar</a><br /><br />Like others, I can't believe this product is actually on the market as an edible food.  Walden Farms should market this to the CIA and FBI as a way to get terrorist and criminals to unload information.  It would work and would be very price effective.  I couldn't even swallow a teaspoon of it.  Horrible."
A14RL2JNYPWURR,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,AWFUL!!!!,"Have tried other Walden Farms products in the past and have been satisfied, but this has got to be one of the most awful tasting concoctions ever.  I wasn't expecting it to be great, as most diet food substitutions are less than stellar, but I was not prepared for just how awful this was.  It literally made me gag.  I'd rather do without peanut butter in any form than to ever again be subjected to this product."
AXJGCAD36N915,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,It's HORRIBLE!,"I can't begin to tell you how awful this stuff is. If you're looking for a peanut-butter substitute, you will be sorely disappointed. I'd rather eat NOTHING than this."
A2XSMM89SI8P6Y,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Tastes like an industrial chemical,"The consistency is in the ballpark of peanut butter, the smell is pretty good - but this stuff tastes, really, like industrial glue.  It has an awful chemical taste to it that is not likened to peanut butter in the least.  I did not try mixing it with anything, that may have helped, especially if what you mixed it with neutralized the taste!  I like WF products, but they need to go back to the drawing board on this one."
APBLUDQUCZQE4,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,this stuff is disgusting,"i generally like fat-free and sugar-free foods, and i would even say that i prefer some of them to their full-fat and full-calorie counterparts.  i had read all of the negative reviews about this peanut spread, so i had low expectations.  but even so, it was worse that i could imagine.  this stuff is slimy and salty and disgusting.  i tried to feed it to my dog, but he wouldn't even eat it."
ATZ3JVMOZ4AVY,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Yuck,I bought this product because I am a big peanut butter fan and I am trying to maintain a healthy weight.  This definitely is not the answer - consistency was awful and taste was terrible - will definitely drop calories elsewhere and continue to eat real peanut butter -  sorry!
A1BF90NXMYKR9V,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Do not buy!,"I have to say that I didn't have too much continence in this being a great product but I have been looking for a low fat peanut butter alternative. I am used to having to make some sacrifices in taste for the sake of health. But, I cannot recommend this to anyone. It smells horrid and tastes just as bad. Maybe if they didn't whip it the texture wouldn't be so slimy. I have never tried any other Walden Farms products so I hope their other items have a better taste, smell and texture."
A3M6C64BXIB04S,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not good,I try to be positive about most things. However I cannot endorse or recommend this product. It does not even resemble peanut butter. I even tried it with real jelly and could not cover the bad taste. It has a strong taste but not a peanut butter taste. I can't compare it to anything I have ever tasted.
A1A7I1BIU4L9UV,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Worst of the product line,"I agree with A Kid's Review, below -- this is definitely the worst Walden Farms product I've tried so far. I love their salad dressings and fruit spreads, but this is not up to par. I won't say it's HORRIBLE (though my son did indeed say that), but I won't be buying it again."
A1GRYVLDBXIIDK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,dont buy it,"Walden Farms makes some good products but this is not one.<br />It is downright horrible.<br />I am not picky, this stuff looks great but tastes like chemicals."
A2BUB0UD3125JI,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Zero Stars Alone,"I struggled with the star rating, because on its own it's zero stars.  Kinda icky.<br /><br />However, mixed with regular peanut butter at a ratio of about 60% PB and 40% WF, it's really not bad at all.  It takes care of my PB cravings and is almost as satisfying as a full serving of real PB.  It's good enough to at least use up this (expensive) jar instead of throwing it out.<br /><br />That said, I think I'll try PB2 next time since it's getting pretty good reviews for less calories than the mix I made."
A3PWH0K8D6F13S,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,What a disappointment,"I bought this product thinking it would at least taste a little like peanut butter but it doesn't taste anything like peanut butter.  All you taste is a very artificial intense sweetness and a little grittiness.  I wanted to wipe my tongue with a tissue, it was that bad.  I bought this from a grocery store and would love to return it but I've opened and used it so I will just have to toss it out.  I looked at their website for a money back guarantee but there is none, all it states is that it's 100% guaranteed, which doesn't really mean anything.  I could give it to my dog but I am not that cruel.  Save your money, this stuff is NASTY."
A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Fails the most basic pass/fail test...TASTE,"I really really wanted to tolerate this product.  Peanut butter is a favorite of mine, but alas, I am a low-carb dieter.  I'm surfing the low-carb sites, and stumble upon this product.  I think, ""Lots of negative reviews, but what if I do like it.  Hey, it's a matter of taste--and no calories at all...WOW.""  Bottom line, I could not tolerate the taste.  My impression is that it tasted like a really bad apple butter, made with sacharine.  So, I hate to jump on the bandwagon...but there are much better low-carb alternatives:  sunbutter, almond butter, and even Smart Balance peanut butter all have relatively low net carbs, and taste decent.  I doubt anyone will come up with something that's low-fat or low-cal, and still retain the taste.  Sorry to say, but Walden Farms sure didn't."
AM9L5NAMJKCZC,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,well its not peanut butter,"whatever you do. do not take a spoonful straight from the jar to your taste buds. i did this. raw product tastes more like the peanut shells in peanut butter form. i ""cut"" it with straight peanut butter im at a 50/50 mix. after this its good on apples(my 3yo likes it) so it either needs to be mixed into real peanut butter or added as a filler. i love eating apples and peanut butter but not the 400+ calories that go with the peanut butter. just as you buy this product know this, its not peanut butter, its peanut spread."
A2YFXAPXUUTSDQ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,O.K. It's not Peanut Butter!,You can't really expect a 0 calorie product to taste like the real thing but this one does a satisfactory job of satisfying the peanut butter craving.  I've lost 25 lbs and I have used this product regularly as a snack.  I mix 1/2 tablespoon of regular peanut butter to two tablespoons of Walden Farms.  It taste o.k....and cuts the calorie count and cravings...not bad on low carb toast!
A2DKTLTZ03O8EF,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,disappointed...gagged.,"I stumbled upon this product when I was looking for low sugar peanut butter in an attempt to create a delicious low-carb snack.  The flavor isn't horrible, just bland.  The worse part was the texture.  It was like fluffy oil in your mouth.  Very slimy...I threw it out."
A2O6FV51JKZKWQ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Weird, but passable","How could anyone truly substitute peanut butter? You're right. They can't! However, this stuff has a whipped texture comparable to cake frosting and is palatable when used on low-calorie brownies and such. Also, PB2, a powdered peanut butter can be added to this to give it a more realistic flavor with only 45 calories per serving. I'm on a calorie-restricted meal plan and use it just how I suggested you should above."
A1V0RP75B2G3L4,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Tonight I dined in hell,"Unlike many, I did not buy this product as a diet aid. I purchased it because I have medical conditions that require me to very carefully monitor my intake of both carbohydrates and fats, lest I want to find myself in for a Very Bad Time. As a result, it has been a very long time since I've gotten to enjoy things like peanut butter, jam, and so on. When I saw this at the local store I was excited because finally, I'd get one of my favorites back.<br /><br />How wrong I was. Avoid this AT ALL COSTS. I'm very forgiving with my special dietary products. Substitutes will never be the same as the real thing, but this doesn't even come close. It's not in the same ballpark, or city. It's not even on the same planet. The ""whipped"" texture is a sensory nightmare, and refrigeration doesn't firm it up in the least. The only thing worse is the taste. It tastes like vaguely sweet chemicals. There's nothing even sort of peanut-y about it.<br /><br />I enjoy some of Walden Farms' other products, like the pancake syrup and salad dressings. This, however, was $4 down the drain and almost the contents of my stomach as well. I miss peanut butter, but I don't miss it THIS much. It's not even worth putting in a shake or something because, being calorie-free, there's no protein in it to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />(I had it with the strawberry fruit spread, which is not spreadable in the least and is also revolting.)"
A3U9TWWIYMP6RR,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Terrible PB Substitute,"I was so excited to see this product because, as another poster mentioned, I tend to eat way too much regular peanut butter! I spread some on half of a pita and some fruit preserves on the other half, and the taste was terrible. They did try to make it nutty, but it almost had a really salty taste to it. It probably wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, and I will try to make myself tolerate it, but it just isn't good."
A2W31WM1NRZXWX,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Not horrendous, but certainly not a replacement for the real thing","I decided to try this even after reading the bad reviews. It doesn't taste like nothing but chemicals to me or anything necessarily bad and the smell is not horrible. I actually think the best way to describe the taste is as Cream of Nothing with a slight nutty flavour. Not bad, but they need to tweak the formula a little before I can consider this a viable alternative to actual peanut-anything."
A1P2B4L2WYTKTE,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,nothing like peanut butter,"That being said, one of my downfalls is my sweet tooth. I discovered that if you spread this on apple slices, it is very sweet, very satisfying, gets that craving outta my system. So, yeah, not peanut butter, but I do really like it, am on my 3rd jar so far."
A2AY4TE05DPJ4X,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,There must be something wrong with me...,"You'd think all the rotten reviews on here would turn me away from the peanut butter!  I thought it looked like peanut butter.  Kind of smells like peanut butter, too.  I dipped my knife in to taste it and was prepared for all kinds of bad......but it's really good.<br />It doesn't stick to the roof of your mouth.......it's not thick like peanut butter, but spreadable..a little sweeter than the full-calorie versions I'm used to.<br />I tried it on it's own, without jam or crackers and I could eat a PB&J with no problems.<br />Thank you Walden Farms....I'm gonna save 1,000 calories this month with your help!"
A16F8IW5NK9Y4Q,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,The worst food this long time dieter has ever tasted,"I eat a low fat, low cholesterol diet, and have for several years. I eat plenty of diet products: only artificial sweeteners, diet cokes, nonfat yogurt, sugar free syrup, etc. Peanut butter is my weakness, and when I saw this product, I was excited. I knew that it would probably not taste exactly like peanut butter, but hoped it would taste somewhat palatable and I could adjust any yuckiness myself by adding some artificial sweetener or other diet food.<br /><br />When I opened the jar, it looked like peanut butter, but sure didn't smell like it. It smelled like super glue. The chemical odor was overpowering. I wanted to throw it out right away, but decided to at least taste it first. I put a miniscule amount on the tip of my tongue, and it tasted even worse than it smelled. It's difficult to describe the many variations of disgustingness that permeated my taste buds during that millisecond, but after that moment, ""PFFT!"" The jar disappeared into the trash can."
A2VOXXK67TNP5B,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,run away. far away.,"please, for the love of everything good and sane, do not order this. I can eat almost anything, and I've always been a very adventurous eater. At 6 years old, I ate sushi, and every vegetable, including brussel sprouts. That is because all of these things were actual food. This ""peanut butter"" is not food. If you must, order it yourself just so you know for sure, but I threw it out after putting my finger in and licking it. I feel sick now...."
A2D0LOKJ52KYA7,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,It is zero calories...,"To be perfectly clear, this does not taste like peanut butter.  But, it is pretty close to zero calories, and with that in mind you have to lower your expectations.  Obviously, fake food is not going to taste as good as real food.  Real peanut butters are better.  However, for someone watching their caloric intake, it is a good alternative because it can replace peanut butter and is tolerable.<br />Side note: it is much better on things than when plain."
A1OX919S0QOJ7B,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,DISGUSTING PRODUCT,"Walden Farms peanut spread is disgusting.  Has the texture of something a sick dog would leave behind and tastes horrible.  It doesn't taste anything like peanuts or peanut butter... provides a mouthful of strange tasting chemicals with a strange texture.  The ONLY good thing about the stuff is that Walmart, where I bought it, will take what's left back.  Its a shame this review process doesn't have a 1/4 star feature.  And, Louise, my cat who loves peanut butter won't touch the stuff.... that has to tell you something... Right?"
AG5IKWC6OQI5Y,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.,"Does not come close to peanut butter taste. Even added peanut favoring with NO success.  Mixed with real peanut butter and achieved mild flavor.  I GIVE THIS NO STARS, BUT CAN'T MAKE THAT ONE GO AWAY."
A15F4DR7GDNB86,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,HORRIBLE,I was on Amazon browsing for peanut flour when I saw this come up.  I bought this a couple months ago from our local grocery store.  It. Is. Horrible.  Gross.  Nasty.  Do not buy it.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter and is has almost a greasy texture.  Reminds me of olean or something that is indigestible and just blows through the intestines.
A38288VYNPMBQF,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,What's the hubbub?,"Why the bad reviews of this product? It's tasty, filling, and zero-calorie. What more do people who are presumably watching what they eat want?<br /><br />Addendum: I've ordered this product several times through Vitacost and one time I did have a problem with an order. But Vitacost corrected it. So we're two for two here: first-rate product and good customer service."
A2FIQW9VHSWZ6Q,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Not a Stand Alone, but Good with Some Tweeks","I have to say, when I saw this product, I was excited.  I was looking for sugar-free peanut butter (which Wal-Mart doesn't carry) and happened upon this.  I bought a jar, against my daughter's cries of ""No Calories, No Sugar, No Fat, NO TASTE MOM!)<br /><br />I eat it on celery and without the added flavor of jelly, it really leaves a lot to be desired.  However, when I mixed it with 1/3 natural peanut butter and 2/3 of this, I was pleasantly suprised.  IT IS NOT THE SAME, and I don't want you to think it is!  But, for a peanut spread mixed with peanut butter, for one third of the calories, fat and sugar....it is good and makes me feel like I am eating healthier!"
A2YNRDTWQVBX9A,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Worst Walden Farms product. Makes a lousy PB&J sandwich.,"I love Walden Farms dressings and pancake syrup.  However, the peanut spread is the worst product I have ever used.  It is edible, but makes a lousy PB&J sandwich.  The spread is so thin it absorbs into the bread and results in a very unsatisfying ""jelly"" sandwich instead. I would rather eat the full-fat, full-calorie version of real peanut butter instead of using this product just to save calories.  At least a real PB&J sandwich fills me up and doesn't leave my hungry for something else."
A36MXDRFWLXDRT,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not what I had hoped!!!,I was out grocery shopping when I came across this product. I got really excited to try it and couldn't wait to get home. I love peanut butter and everyone knows how high in calories it is so having a substitue for it made my day! As soon as I got home I made me a bowl of oatmeal and fixed it like I always do with a PB and a little bit of cocoa but I replaced the regular PB with this spread. Its was pretty good...not fabulous but definetly tolerable. A few days down the road I decided to make a PB&J sandwich with this spread......seriously took a bite and gagged. I couldn't eat it!<br /> I would say that it is ok if your mixing it in something but not alone or on a sandwich. I've also tried another one of their products but it tastes gross too. I hate to throw it away because I bought it but I really don't thnk I could stomach it again.
ACTZ5CMMBOZ5B,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Depends on what you eat with it,"I actually go this at Wal-Mart. It's decent, I mean you can't expect something with zero calories to satisfy completely. I tried it on a sandwhich first which did not taste very good, I must say. It kind of tasted like I just sprinkled some salt on bread. BUT...I love celery, carrots, apples, ect. in peanut butter (which completely ruins the whole point of eating healthy fruit), so I use this instead and it's VERY GOOD. Also, I haven't tried this yet, but I bet if mixed with a Tbsp of real peanut butter, it would be amazing."
A1A3DTGQZR0TEZ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Pretty good for no cal.,"I have never tried Walden Farms products until I saw this Peanut spread. The no calories part grabbed me. I love peanut butter, but not plain. It is just too hard to eat. This spread is creamy and doesn't stick to the inside of your mouth. It has a nutty mellow taste. It is not supposed to be peanut butter! It is a substitute! I'm recommend trying it."
A1UOGJ27MB2YAT,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,DISGUSTING,"i cant even eat it i tried it and almnost shrew up! threw 2 brand mnew jars away, this product is not food its like eating glue"
A1WKU93AL267G,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"It doesn't taste like peanut butter, BUT...","No this does not taste like peanut butter, but neither does Sunflower seed, almond, cashew, or any of the other nut/seed butters. If you get past whether the taste is similar to peanut butter, you find it's actually pretty good. Stop comparing and enjoy the product for its own unique taste.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it has a mild gelatinous texture. But honestly its barely noticeable - and what are we to expect from something with ZERO calories?<br /><br />A side note for use: I enjoy mixing it with a nut butter (I like almond but of course you could do peanut or any other). If you mix it 50/50 you've just cut everything in half (calories, carbs, fats, etc...), and it taste delicious mixed!!! Just a thought."
AZJZ6F6G91CSN,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,For Use In Protein Shakes Only,"I knew I wouldn't use this as a spread, but in protein shakes and therein it does the job.....makes the shake delicious, low fat, low cal, which is what I was looking for, since a 1/2 banana and regular PB just make my breakfast too fattening and calorie laden.  I am wondering about the ingredients, but since I'm also concerned about my weight, and finding ways to enjoy lo-cal/lo-fat food, it's a trade-off.  In anything but a shake, I imagine it would be horrid, but one tablespoon does the trick in shakes."
A3D9LM07P8CXI,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,A Little Miracle in a Jar,"This ""peanut butter"" is CALORIE FREE for goodness sake!  Yes, the taste has a few ISSUES, but it still remains a miracle food.  When I first purchased it, I thought that I would have to mix it with regular peanut butter.  However, somehow (miraculously?), the taste grew on me.  I combine it with the Walden Farms CALORIE FREE jams, and I use it on a variety of foods, including salads. I believe that liking any of the Walden Farms products is less about taste and more about personality.  If you are someone who would rather have a dollop of high-calorie elixir than a bowl of zero-calorie approximations of elixir, then forget Walden Foods.  However, if a dollop of paradise only makes you lust after the entire vat of paradise, then head on over to Walden Foods and train your palate to appreciate the freedom of zero-guilt."
A21NIEZWY49KID,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,At least it mixes!,"This stuff tastes like butt... with a hint of peanuts. LOL.<br /><br />Honestly, my hopes for it weren't very high, what with all the reviews and such, but I wanted to try it for myself anyway. I like diet sodas and can tolerate fat-free versions, so I thought that might be the case with this. Haha, nope. It really just tastes terrible. The consistency reminds me of yogurt or pie filling, though don't let that give off the wrong impression that it tastes good, lol.<br /><br />BUT. It mixes well. If I measure 25% real peanut butter and 75% of this (like two teaspoons peanut butter and one tablespoon plus two teaspoons Walden Farms), it actually does taste okay, and that's about 45 calories a serving versus nearly 200. So, it is at least somewhat redeeming of itself in that sense.<br /><br />I recently ordered the PB2 powder because I heard it mixed well with that too. I will update this once I try it myself."
A1VKHZIEC3BEE,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Walde Farms, Peanut Spread","while I have used many Walden Farms items and been very happy with them  I am sorry I can't say that about this product.  Being a peanut fanatic, the flavor was less than acceptable."
A2IO1H5EI3L9N6,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Absolutely Horrible,"I love PB and eat way too much of it.  I have tried Walden Farms salad dressings and liked them, so thought it was worth giving thier peanut spread a try.  What a mistake, I couldn't wait to get it out of my mouth.  I brought it to work for my co-workers to try, since they also like this brands salad dressing, but they all had the same reaction that I did.  There isn't enought jelly in the world to make this edible."
AX0QCWW8RFNO7,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Gross,Really really.... nasty. Don't recommend wasting your money on this. Oh and when mine came the cheap plastic lid was broken. Thanks Amazon.
A2OWLYTLYCF5NI,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Yay Rich creamy peanut butter...NOT!!!,"I'm a fan of different types of nut based spreads(more like my favorite staple food everyday) . So I have tried sunflower butter, almond butter, cashew butter, honey roasted peanut butter, honey flavored in all types, and the list goes on you get the picture. After a while for my training I started to use PB2 both chocolate and regular type for there low fat percent during cut season. So I saw this I say I give it a try. I saw the massive negative reviews and ignored it and say I'll give it a whirl. VERY BAD IDEA!!!. I tried just a teaspoon expecting a great peanut taste. All I got was a mixture of salty and mushy buttery paste. I didn't even taste the peanut flavor it kind of reminded me of when you taste bottom dregs of a salted peanut bag.<br /><br />****HOWEVER, it seems after testing it out with my friends, family, relatives and strangers who came over to house that people who kinder liked salty foods(asked them at the end if they liked salt or not) didn't mind it or liked it****<br /><br /> Calorie free peanut butter...ha I should have known. Only PB2 comes close the fewest calories without sacrificing the taste. Now time to experiment more on this jar of oddness to see if it's possible even remotely make it taste descent."
A23RQVQ92D2UCT,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Not too bad, not great","I don't know what is with these 1-star reviewers who expected to be able to just shove this stuff directly into their face.  It is a food substitute, and if one knows anything about food substitutes, then you must realize that they're meant to be used in a normal context for that item.  Not meant to be eaten straight out of the jar, in other words.<br /><br />That said, it works fine on a bagel, or on a banana, but as some other reviewers said, it is a little on the salty side.  It doesn't really taste peanut buttery either.  It's a good spread, it just does not really evoke... peanut butter.  It's good as a food item, it is NOT good if you are on a diet, wanting to kill someone for peanut butter.  (Not the case for me, but I have other food items that do that to me.)<br /><br />I know that Walden Farms tries very hard to create no-calorie alternatives, and that they've succeeded wonderfully with the salad dressings.  Seriously, thank GOD for their salad dressings, because I love a salad, but hate thinking about how many calories most commercial dressings bring... but this one just fails it's intention.  I give it a three star, because it's not inedible.  It tastes... okay.  It just doesn't taste like peanut butter at all."
A3DVYV9BH9P9UU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,OK -- for what it is,"I've now tried multiple Walden Farms dips, dressings, and syrups. Some are better than others: for example, the Chocolate dip and Honey Dijon dressing are quite good but I wouldn't buy the Orange Marmalade again. I'm glad that I didn't read these reviews, however, before I bought the Peanut Spread. It is really OK when you mix it with sugar-free jellies and jams. If you can't give up real peanut butter, then don't buy this product. But if you have 90-100 lbs or more to lose like me, and you love the peanut taste, then this Peanut Spread might work for you. Note that I also use the fine product PB2 in my oatmeal in place of real peanut butter. Following some of the suggestions in these reviews I will try to bump up the peanut taste of the Peanut Spread with some PB2."
A3A8FZUI0OGZCA,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Great alternative to cut with real peanut butter,"I agree with another reviewer who likened comparing this product to diet coke vs real coke. No it doesn't taste like peanut butter, however, it has a compatible taste with a fluffy texture that blends perfectly with it. Another reviewer described it as being like jello. I would say more like a cross between jello and cool whip. I use it mixed in a 2:1 ratio with real peanut butter to spread on apples and celery. In a 2:1 ratio it works very well. To be honest, I think that if I wanted to eat it straight, I wouldn't find it very enjoyable. It would be like trying to cut peanut butter with diet/nonfat cool whip to stretch the volume out. Would you want to eat the cool whip all alone as a snack or on bread? No. The taste blends perfectly with the real thing to allow you to eat 2/3 fewer calories. This is a big accomplishment to me. Normally I take in 3 tbl. of peanut butter if I were to be honest every time I add peanut butter to something and that is with measuring. With this product, I am not taking in 300 calories for a small little snack. Instead, I am consuming only 100 and yet still feel full."
A368H82Q1PNM9G,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,terrible,"As others have said, this product should receive zero stars and negative ratings.  It is honestly terrible and does taste like chemicals.  I thought the flavor could be masked in oatmeal, on sandwiches or with apples and raisins, but no such luck.  Not to mention the texture is gross and more like a pudding than a real pb.  I would not recommend this to anyone, no matter how diet conscious one is trying to be-buy freshly ground organic nut butters that deliver taste, texture and protien!"
AS462XXCZFKEA,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,NOT RECOMMENDED!,"I researched this as a replacement for peanut butter due to an addiction I seem to have. I did not actually purchase it on Amazon because I saw it one day in the grocery store and thought I was lucky so I grabbed it. I rarely review products but this one was soooo bad I felt the need to so no one else would waste their money like I did.<br />The first thing I noticed was the texture. I thinks it best compares to packaged low fat pudding made with skim milk. I could have gotten past the texture but the smell almost deterred me from even tasting it. It smells like what would happen if the makers of PlayDoh decided to make a peanut or peanut butter version of their PlayDoh. Very odd.<br />So now to the most important thing, the taste. Not as bad as the smell, but definitely not something I would more than just taste. It had a hint of roasted peanut but that was really it. This stuff was just weird.<br />I swallowed about 1 tsp just because I am a trooper and I wanted to give it a fair chance. But the jar went straight into the trash afterwards.<br />I have not tried any other low calorie peanut butters yet, I'm actually a little scared to now. I usually have no problem with diet foods, sweet n low, splenda etc... but this stuff is just not for me."
A2BJF5UWHR91N8,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Calorie fat free peanut spread,Slight peanuty taste. Does not taste at all like authentic peanut butter but when used with sugar free jelly suffices your craving for peanut butter taste with no calories especially if you are on a diet.
ASYB9U1S5XQGB,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Tastes Fake,"This tastes really fake, like chemicals. Natural peanut butter is high in calories but healthy in moderation. I probably won't use the Walden Farms version I bought."
A2D2XOBXVF2V07,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,A Real Loser for Walden Farms!,"Most Walden Farms products -- and I've tried over a dozen -- I'd rate four to five stars.  Perhaps not as good as the high calorie stuff, but outstanding for zero calories and zero carbs.<br /><br />However, this peanut spread is nothing short of disgusting.  It tastes more like chemicals, very little like peanut butter.  I took one taste and threw the balance in the garbage.  Save you money!  But do try their salad dressings and syrups!"
A2T4MFWUS3JZGL,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,I would give it zero stars if possible..,This stuff was terrible! I took one spoonful to taste it right after I bought it and then threw it away.  It tasted nothing like peanut butter.  I like the idea of it because even low fat peanut butter still has tons of fat in it... but this was not even edible.  There are other peantu butter options out there that are low in fat but still taste good.
ALGWUHZQ9292K,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Awful! No taste whatsoever,"Okay so I am on a diet and I love peanut butter and wanted to try something that was similar to peanut butter and i knew this wouldn't be too similar to peanut butter but this was completely awful...I even tried adding some sugar to try and get it down, reasoning with the idea that it may be good after all with a little added touch. No way! I could hardly get this down and was very disappointed. This had no taste and the worst subsitution for anything like peanut butter. i will say though that this product is guaranteed and Walden Farms will send you your money back if you don't like it just call them like I did.  Just proves it has to have some calories in it to taste good"
A1C3WKY6CEBTMK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not as bad as you are led to believe,"It's calorie free, so it's OBVIOUSLY not going to taste too much like peanut butter.  Anyone who expects that is - obviously - going to be disappointed.  That aside, it does taste pretty good for having zero calories.  When combined with something else, like in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it would taste great.  I even eat it straight out of the jar sometimes, hehe.  The only thing is the texture - its main ingredient, I believe, is cellulose gum, so it has a very gelatinous texture.  So in that respect, it is very unlike peanut butter.  But it still is a very good substitute.  By the way, I didn't detect any chemical taste to it whatsoever - perhaps the flavor varies by region, or according to different palates.  I would buy it again."
A1NQLLPAU29QYU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Disgusting.. waste of money!,"This product tastes NOTHING like peanut butter.. it basically just tastes like a bunch of chemicals. Its disgusting. I have bought a half dozen Walden Farms products, and I have yet to like any of them. I can't believe they've even made it to store shelves.  Every time I try another one of their products, hopeful that it tastes decent, I end up throwing the whole jar out. Waste of money."
AGBDDLLALN18S,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,wrong texture,"the peanut butter is not verry thick and it doesnt realy taste that good by its self, maybe if you use it in a peanut sauce on chicken or something it might be good."
A35DEUQS5BTA19,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Don't waste your money!!!,This stuff is terrible!!!!<br /><br />Better n Peanut Butter is yummy.  Buy that instead.
A2LWWHMABFQ0KS,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,YUCK!!!,I did not like this product at all.  It was very artifical tasting and texture was not good.  I'll go back to the real peanut butter thank you.  Shipping was almost as costly as the product.
A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Never Ever Again,"Regardless of why one would need to eat a low fat diet or low cal diet, there is no reason to suffer through this stuff. I bought it because I just love the chocolate dip (highly recommended- not plain of course) and thought that despite my initial skepticism about Walden Farms' no calorie line that it must all be pretty good. So, I bought the peanut spread, raspberry jam spread and marsh mellow spread and it was incredibly disappointing. I understand dealing with something that is a little below par in the spirit of losing weight or medical issues BUT this stuff is awful. There is a strong lingering chemical taste that - despite of others claiming the chocolate dip has, and doesn't to me- the peanut spread leaves no matter what you mix it with. Because I spent the four bucks I'm having a hard time throwing it away but the only thing that I can fathom even trying to do with it is bake, and I'm not even sure that would turn out alright. I will try that, but I think as far as Walden's line I'll stick with the chocolate dip and not venture to try anything else."
A32Q5HN7RQN6GL,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Thanks God I Didn't Read Reviews First,"I discovered this great product about 2 months ago and since then have consumed five jars of it. I love it. Hardly a day goes by when I don't have some. No it isn't peanut butter but it has a near nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry seems to work best) makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this ""Peanut Spread"" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons)."
A33XGXSC6K5VWQ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Ok, it's not peanut butter... but they tried","I love PB and can't eat it at all during my cutting phases because I tend to eat way too much of it and go over my calorie and fat limit for the day.  (It's great for getting the correct ratio of healthy fats into your diet for bulking phases though!)  I've tried other PB substitues like Better 'N Peanut Butter and PB2(PB2 is a powdered peanut butter mix with about 1/4 the calories and fat of regular PB, and it tastes just like the normal stuff) and they are not bad.  But I still can't eat as much of it as I want.<br /><br />As soon as I saw this, my first thought was ""SWEET!!! THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD!""  I read some reviews, thought for 25 seconds, ordered 3 jars, and didn't really have too high of expectations since it is a calorie free product.<br /><br />Well, it kind of tastes like roasted peanuts... kind of.  I'd say it's more of a fake sugar/bitter coffee/peanut flavored pudding product.  If you can imagine the aftertaste you get from the fake sugar in diet coke, you can kind of imagine this.<br /><br />It's not a total failure though, because I am still going to use this, but not by itself.  I tried mixing a few tablespoons of this with a tablespoon of regular creamy PB and a little bit of PB2 powder.  The normal PB enhances the peanut taste where this stuff left off, and the PB2 gives it the right texture.  After all that, it's really not bad.  I'd even say pretty good.  Regular PB has about 100 calories per tablespoon and a ton of fat.  This mixed PB concoction has maybe 25 calories per tablespoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />The walden farms grape jelly is great, and does taste like real jelly.  And I'll use it with the peanut butter mix on light wheat bread, and you have a fairly good 200 calorie PB&J sandwich (that's 1/4 the calories and fat of a normal PB&J)."
AOKOUB6H2P1NS,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,WORSE THAN AWFUL,"OK, I am very health concious and watch calories, carbs and fat content. I like regular PB very much but it has a lot of calories so I thought I would try this. Immediately after opening kind of a greenish brown color and pudding consistency. When I first looked at it my thoughts definitely were not of PB but something much worse. Then I tasted it. I would have to say that the taste and texture were the same as that much worse item that comes in about the same color. This stuff is totally GROSS. Do not waste your money. Save the calories and have the real thing. At least with real PB you get some nutritional value. I do think Walden Farms could market this as an appetite suppresant."
A3BR0J7FPVWSHK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,This product highly offended me,"I am on the Medifast diet, so was looking for a few low carb/low calorie options to add to my daily diet.  When I heard about Walden Farms calorie free peanut butter I was highly skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I have to say, that this product was probably THE worst tasting diet food I have ever eaten.  I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and thought maybe this would slightly resemble it, but the taste was nowhere close.  This product SERIOUSLY offended me.  I would give it to a homeless person, but I'm not that cruel.  If you're looking for peanut butter substitutes I'd recommend PB2.  It contains only peanuts and salt, and actually tastes like peanuts.<br /><br />Walden Farms DOES have good products, though.  I will say that their caramel dip is very good, but I wonder why they are still able to make enough money from this ""peanut butter"" to keep producing it!"
A1SLZFVEA0SM61,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,This is Peanut Butter?,"I can't believe that Walden Farms markets this product! The taste is blah,the texture is gluey. If I liked pb cookies I might bake with it. I ended up throwing it out. I'll suck up the calories and carbs from other products. Truly disappointted as I use the WF salad dressings all the time (sometimes as a marinade). A big stinkofor the PB!"
A21UP2SG3HXY6J,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Great Product!,"Don't expect to use it exactly as you would use peanut butter.  Just think, peanut butter is loaded with fat and calories and this has none.  If you want the peanut butter flavor without the calories, this is an excellent product.  I have just started using it to add flavor to my protien shakes (banana peanut butter flavor, for example) and I love it!  I don't know if I would use it to make PB&J sandwiches, but that's OK.  Now I can finally have my peanut butter and eat it too!  I'm thilled that a company has developed this product!"
A18NTWLUF9Y6B3,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Great,Yes good way to overcome the peanut butter without the guilt and taste pretty good received in timely manner i would buy again from this seller AAAAAAAAAA+++++++++
A3JQZONKUQT4Q1,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,YUCK!,This product for all intensive purposes is a great idea! It smells like a peanut shell. Tastes like nothing...it would have to be an aquired taste to eat this regularly. So I am mixing it with real peanut butter to give volume but to have a better taste with less calories.!
A7DYBL9YAEHAZ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Gross,"This is the most nastiest stuff I have ever tasted, way to sweet for it to not have any sugars in it, they should lay off the splenda, and add more peanut flavor"
AKEWAQNGZBBFJ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Really Tough to Take,"It took me two weeks after purchase to get the nerve up to try it. Apparently my psychic abilities were working overtime because its pretty tough to take. A work mate said ""what, are you crazy? Put real peanut butter on a lettuce leaf, a piece of celery, a rice cake, but don't even try imitations."" Frankly, it was a waste of money because I put it in the kitchen with a note to all to help themselves...no one has yet."
A1JUA26HV2CKA2,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Gross - Like Eating Vaseline,"I'm on MediFast, and a number of people use Walden Farms products to keep their fat/carb/calories down.  Like an idiot, I went to the grocery store and bought about 8 or 9 of the products that were raved about -- IT WASN'T CHEAP!<br /><br />This peanut spread is yucky. It is still in my fridge until I can think of something to do with it.  I don't want to waste it because it was expensive."
A18ZEMA7Y1HPMN,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Do not waste your money!,"Like everyone who loves peanut butter. but prefers to eat lower calorie foods, I was excited to find this in the store. It is completely inedible. I cannot see how anyone could have thought this tasted well enough to produce and sell. I really did want to like it, but just the memory of how bad it tasted is enough to make me queasy. Instead of focusing on being ""calorie-free"" Walden Farms should reformulate the product so it can be low in calories, but actually taste good."
A1T6C1X1CG9BEA,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,YUCK!,"Don't waste your time!  This went straight in the trash.  It doesn't at all come close to the taste of PB.  I eat allot of un-conventional foods, but this was really bad.  It has the consistency of a mix between pudding and cool whip and a TERRIBLE after taste!  I really had high hopes, but for such an expensive product, I expected more."
A2CTA9LOIK9U2R,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,decent alternative,"I am shocked to see so many negative reviews here. Are you for real people? To my opinion it doesn't taste bad at all taking in consideration that it is calorie free. I am on HCG diet right now I can't eat pretty much anything. It's not really hard to maintain myself on 500 cal a day diet, but watching my husband munching on all the yummies does give me cravings. Discovering Walden Farms products was a savior to me. I've tried about 5 products so far and I think reviewed a few already. But this peanut spread is somewhat close to my opinion. Now, I have to mention that it tastes the best with crackers or fruit, but not on it's own. It smells like peanut butter spot on, but taste is close but not it. I can't complain however because it's calorie free and I can eat it a lot, even being on the diet. Everyone knows that diet food supposed to be awful, but it's much better than that and guilt free."
A2MA9G2FJMEMJS,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Putrid!,"Please, please, please, do not listen to anyone who claims this is a decent product.  I have tried all sorts of foods designed to cut fat/calories, etc.  This is by far the worst I have ever experienced.  My wife and I could not believe this stuff was even marketable.  Seriously, a lot of folks hate fat-free mayo or fat free ranch dressing.  This is 1000 times beyond those items in terms of terrible!  I even tried to get my dachshunds to sample it; they wouldn't!  And they eat everything!  It's like a plastic goo!  We threw it all away.  We had low expectations when we bought this.  But it was so much worse than we could imagine.  Beware!  Save yourself some money.  Spread face cream on a slice of bread.  It will taste better!  Ooof!"
A2NCS47VKDPBPV,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not a bad way to cut one's calorie intake,"The texture is definitely what the product calls itself - a spread.  Not creamy like a regular peanut butter, but not entirely disgusting either.  As far as taste, I would say it is very similar to peanut brittle, just enough peanut flavor and very sweet.  Definitely a good side for sliced apple pieces or other fruit.  For use in sandwiches, I would agree with the other reviewers who suggest mixing this with a tablespoon of regular or even low fat peanut butter just to bump the taste up a bit and add a creamier texture to it.  We did this for my wife, who is very particular about what she eats and she had no complaints about using this to cut her calories in half.  Overall I give it a 3 for taste a 3 for texture and a 5 for effort. This is definitely a product that begs to be experimented with in many different recipes."
A38LDSL9X86D7N,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Genuinely unpalatable,"Like a slimy, chemically-tasting, foamy mousse, with metallic sweetness partially masking a sour undertone. Truly unusable as a food, regardless of how similar it may or may not be to peanut butter (not very similar, by the way - general taste profile, density and mouthfeel are all wildly off-base - only aroma seems to match)."
A320NYVVIZSZGY,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Slimy......pretty distasteful......,"It doesn't remind me of peanut butter, one bit.  It's gel like and slippery.  I was so hopeful that it'd be better.  I took one taste and threw it in the recycle bin."
A167ZHCOH3DUBB,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,It isn't good.,"I didn't buy this expecting it to taste anything like peanut butter. All I wanted was peanut flavor. That's all. What I got was the single most awful thing I've ever eaten. I bought my jar from Sprouts, but they sell it in a lot of places. My local Albertson's stocks it. If you are hell-bent on trying it, at least don't pay for shipping. That way it hurts less when you throw it out."
A37DJIVHA864HS,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Blech,"I have issues with portion control when it comes to peanut butter, so I thought the was the perfect solution.  Yes, I read the bad reviews but thought just how bad can it be?  Well, let me tell you this stuff is BAD!  I didn't want to throw it out so I tried mixing it in plain Greek yogurt.  That was a cruel thing to do to the yogurt.  It takes a lot for me to dislike something enough to throw it away, but this stuff was inedible.<br /><br />Now with that said, I also bought the apricot and strawberry jellies and they were good!  I tried mixing that peanut spread with the jelly and that was bad.  Jelly good!  Peanut spread bad.  No way around it.<br /><br />But in the end, I think I rather stick will real whole foods, not processed products.  That's what I get for looking for a short cut."
A32XW4QX7ZYJCB,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Disgusting,"I don't think my expectations for this product were too high. I've had my fair share of diet foods, and especially Walden Farms foods, some of which I absolutely love. This product is not one of them.<br /><br />The texture is something like jello, and the taste is terrible. It's sweet and has a vague peanut taste, but the peanut taste is more of a background flavor. Most of the flavor is occupied by whatever disgusting taste this failed chemistry experiment has combined to make."
A2SUKDHOZ2MM7H,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Putrid,"My daughter and I are on low carb diets.  She purchased this product as an alternative to peanut butter.  Don't make the same mistake.  It is unfortunate we cannot assign a negative number of stars.  She sadly bought the Peanut Butter Raisin variety as well.  I hate raisins, and I'm not stupid, so I didn't make the mistake of trying that one.<br /><br />This jar of congealed chemical matter is, by far, the most disgusting thing to ever have passed my lips.  On the plus side, it has no carbs, no calories, no fat, but it also has no protein, peanuts, or nutritional value of any kind.  It does have sodium.  I can only describe it as peanut flavored fluff.  No, not fluff, more like the gel-like substance in an air freshener.  I don't know what's worse, the flavor or the consistency.  To be labelled Walden Farms is purely scandalous.  It indicates to me that some ingredient within was perhaps in the vicinity of an actual farm.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say about this is, it will be fun to see the expressions on our friends' faces when we get them to taste it."
A103R4UGQS2XWJ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Legal?,"This stuff is where rotten peanut shells go to die. I don't even know how this passed taste tests or if it is even legal to sell. It doesn't taste like peanut butter, and after reading the ingredients I can see why. I'm so upset I passed up the natural peanut butter that was right next to the jar of this muck at the store. I'd much rather have a little bit of full carb/calorie PB than stomach another half teaspoon of this. Caveat emptor everyone."
A3NTD3T0WNWOF8,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,still cringing,"This stuff is the worst.  It tasted like chemicals not peanut butter. I didn't want to waste it so I mixed it with some sugar and flour and cocoa powder to make some ""chocolate, peanut butter"" cookies.  They were not good either but after I frosted them they were passable.  Sort of defeats the purpose of a calorie free spread.  If I didn't have to pay for shipping (bought the peanut butter product at walmart) I would try the other products mentioned by the others that reviewed this product in a similar light- at least I know you all still have your taste buds.  As for the others that gave this high marks, I'm not not sure but I think you should see a doctor as there could be something wrong with your mouth."
A38AEIY8FKGB5P,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,DO NOT BUY,"This product is horrible. I tried it and tried it and tried it again. It just tastes so awful I couldn't stand it.. I tried everything too. Adding things like salt, sugar, skippy, chocolate syrup, and caramel syrup to it. And even ALL of those put together could not drown out the terrible chemical taste of this garbage. Yuck! Please don't waste your money like I did. I barely ever write reviews for products, but for this I MUST. People NEED to be warned of this inhumane, dispicable food. Please just stay away for the good of mankind!"
ANH62P22H7HX8,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,How did this product get past Q&A?!,"Did someone in the Walden Farms labs think this tasted good!?  There isn't even a HINT of peanut taste to this dreadful ""treat"". Walden Farms makes some excellent products but they fell flat on their butts with this one.  The putrid taste is indescribable!  I'd say it probably tastes similar to melted saran wrap.  Ugh!!  Word of advice.  Avoid this like the plague and purchase PB2 instead."
A3ZR78XCY9AVZ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Simply BLECH!,"If you enjoy gnawing on rubber tires and the taste of plastic and chemicals, you'll love this product. Otherwise, STAY AWAY. It is truly disgusting. I am a peanut butter fiend and will pretty much eat ANY PB, but this was totally inedible. I was hoping to find something lower in fat/calories, but this is just criminal. I'll stick with my Naturally More and just have a few spoonfuls."
A1RPVOVIXVQ2TU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,waste of everything,"The only reason I gave this product one star is because Amazon won't let you give a 'NO' star. I was hoping to find a product that could take the place of peanut butter in my diet. I love peanut butter but it is so high in calories and fat. I should have known better than to think there was something out there to take its place. This stuff was horrible. I can't believe a company would actually produce something so horrendous and take consumers hard earned money for it. I paid $4.99 for it and threw it away after I spit out what was in my mouth.  Shame on you Walden Farms for selling this under the pretense of peanut butter. Even more so, for thinking it to be edible."
ANXBWV5LH6KXK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,THE WORST EVER,This was the worst stuff that I have EVER put in my mouth!!  I sure wasted $ on this buy!
A8W6AQ5N6Z4MY,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Upsetting,"Who decided walden farms should sell this product? It's so terrible. The fact they still sell this should be a crime.  Tastes like a packet of splenda mixed with mystery chemicals. Why does it have to be that sweet? It's like they didn't even taste test before this was put on the market. Was this a joke on the consumer or what? I mean it is THAT bad. I told myself I'd eat it because I hate throwing food away, but even opening the jar makes me gag when that awful smell hits my nostrils. What a waste of money. I bought mine at the store, not through amazon, but seeing the other reviews on here, it's going to be terrible either way. I don't normally complain about food but man, this is the worst thing I have ever eaten. I hope there are better alternatives to peanut butter out there than this."
A3NY06UISEQ0N0,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Wrong in every way!,"Again, I did see reviews, but wanted to try myself...the smell, texture and taste is so wrong. It leaves the worst taste in your mouth and the similarity to peanut butter is about 10%. People say, 'what do you expect, it's a no calorie peanut butter butter?' But come on, there's no excuse for that taste!"
A1IPGTZQTJAN50,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"0 Calories, Passable Taste","Watching my calorie intake, I love this product.  No calories which is a huge plus.  I knew the taste wouldn't be as big as the full calorie, full fat peanut butters.  I tried this in a PB&J, tasted just fine to me.  Now if only a local store would carry this product instead of having to order online."
A1EPEQOLUJG5ZU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,70 calorie peanut butter and jelly sandwich,Wish it was thicker and a little more peanut buttery but if you are on a diet and use with light bread walden farms can't be beat.
A3ITLBABDWJ8XW,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Dog crap would have to taste better than this!,"OK...let me be blunt and 100% honest when I say..dog crap would have to taste better than this!!! While I wouldn't recommend eating dog crap, I can't imagine the taste being any worse. Sorry , I know it's crass,but I have never tasted a food product as bad as this. DON'T buy it....you'll have to scrape the horrible taste off of your tongue!"
A1HMF8GVM4CA0G,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Horrible taste (or really no taste, terrible texture)","This is too terrible to describe, except it's disgusting!! It does not remotely taste like peanut butter. The texture is horrible, and you are wasting your money if you purchase this, in my opinion."
AKP43P5D1OOPO,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Worst. Food. Ever.,"I have heard of Walden Farms products for a while now but hadn't had an opportunity to try anything until recently.  If I had to judge Walden Farms based on this one product, I would have to say they deserve to be closed down...this peanut spread was the weirdest, grossest thing I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to eat!  I'm an adventurous eater and this now tops my list of top five worst things I've ever eaten...the smell is similar to peanut butter, with plastic thrown in.  The texture is a cross between pudding and shaving cream and is slightly rubbery in appearance.  The taste...well, I can't come up with an accurate description of the taste, but I will say there was NO peanut flavor and the after-taste of splenda/sugar substitute is unpleasant and lingers for hours (or until you brush your teeth until your gums hurt).  The rubbery appearance translates into a rubbery texture (and I swear it tasted rubbery too) that melts into bread once you spread it...it soaked into my bread and turned my bread to rubber...no amount of jelly made it work.  I made two sandwiches with it and will not harm the bread with it again!  This product has to be the worst ever made...AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS AND CONSIDER YOURSELF SMARTER THAN ME!!!"
A2Y729OLWSQQ8,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,use this for cooking,"this is an excellent product to use when making a low calorie peanut sauce for noodles or vegetables.  i also like a big spoonful in my morning oatmeal, but if you're planning on buying this as a traditional peanut butter replacement, forget about it.  don't spread this on toast or celery, you won't enjoy it.  it isn't peanut butter, but you can definitely make good use of this product.  i've used it as an ingredient in quite a few recipes and served the food to ""normal"" people who gave me rave reviews.  i always refuse to tell them what the secret ingredient is though."
A196A9CBOYRSJI,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,I'm delighted by the peanut spread!!!!,"I have read all these negative reviews and TOTALLY disagree!! I love the peanut spread!! I am a peanut butter fiend, but do not eat it because it is the ""good fat"" and natural has benefits, but no matter what I ALWAYS gain weight when I start buying regular peanut butter. This product is a life saver to me because I can have my peanut butter and eat it too!! Sorry all you discontenders- yo can send me all the peanut spread you do not want!!"
A36WSDKG3J0VJT,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"It aint peanut butter, but it aint calories/carbs either!","This is not the most delicious thing I've ever tasted in my life, but I can definitely appreciate it for what it is...zero calories, zero carbs, sugar free, fat free. I prefer to mix it into shakes for a nut flavor instead of making a PB&J sandwhich out of it. But even w/ a sandwhich, it's not that bad, because w/ the real thing I eat too much. This product gives a little of the taste w/out any of the calories, sugar or fat. It's a good product."
A2IYSJV1O3DEMO,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not Good!,"This is ""fake peanut butter"" to say the least.  It was terrible and left an after taste.  It may be a spread but not to use alone, you have to combine it with a jelly or jam to eat it.  Waste of money."
A2RLOCANTPCCU2,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Peanut Gutter!,"Like one reviewer, I am also a health nut and have adjusted my palate to very natural, sometimes bland food.  Agreeing with the same reviewer, I could not stomach this stuff.  It is utterly gross in taste and smell.  I've tried mixing it with smoothies, brownie mix, even ice-cream.  You cannot mask it.  Spend your money on the real stuff.  The extra calories will be far better than gulping down this ridiculous concoction!"
A26OTT2RMNDJLU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,This product is disgusting!,I do buy several Walden Farms products. However this tastes like sweet glue. It never laid next to a peanut. Come on Walden Farms make some serious changes to this product. Many of us can't afford to throw food out!
A2E1SDNDK85Q0O,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,You HAVE to mix it with...,"This stuff is horrible by itself. I can't even eat it. BUT if you mix this product with normal peanut butter something crazy happens, it taste like Reeses peanut butter! Not even joking. I've played with the portions, but 4 tablespoons of the zero-cal, mixed with about one tablespoon of normal peanut butter does it for me. You can play with the portions to your liking.<br /><br />SO it's not zero calorie once mixed, but I get about 5 tablespoons of pretty awesome peanut butter for the amount of calories in one tablespoon of normal. That's like 2.5 low calorie sandwiches, which is actually a good deal. Worth trying. Just gotta mix."
AOTG413LXWB8O,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Nasty upon Nasty,I'm not a picky eater and will try almost anything. To say this stuff is nasty is an understatement.  Whipped vegetable fiber??? I tried twice to eat it and gagged both times.  but is you like it .. go for it.

A2RZASY4H4NBNQ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,fake is gross!,hey guess what! REAL peanut butter has only 200 calories per serving (2 tbsp) AND it doesn't have fake stuff in it. Do yourself a favor and get some natural peanut butter with no weird chemicals or dyes or fillers and just eat that. Then you don't have to worry about what all that weird stuff is doing inside your colon.
A11I4LJOAOCJ5L,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,IF YOU WANT TO GAG AND THROW UP,"This product is bad. If you can swallow smooth sweet tasting mud, be my guest otherwise stay away from this. It is really really awful!"
A25B7J5LAXH0J1,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Too bad you cannot rate lower than one!,This has to be the worst tasting stuff ever. So excited to find something peanut-buttery that would not harm my diet that I took out a spoon as soon as I got home. It went right in the trash! I was so disappointed. Now I am going to try PB2. Hope I have better luck... My thought when I threw it out was on what planet did the people in product development think this was a successful product. I guess they are counting on fools like me thinking calorie-free PB would taste good. Definitely they are only counting on one time only sales.
A2T3I3KKTOHQNF,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Horrible,"There is only one word that can describe this product and that is vile. I like the Walden Farms salad dressings. However, this whipped spread has a weird chemical flavor, like a petroleum based product. I put just a thin coating on a slice of bread and added jelly to it. The taste of the peanut spread totally covered up the flavor of the jelly.I couldn't throw it in the garbage fast enough. Do not waste your money on this product."
A9BYZZ31654QC,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Most Awful Thing I have EVER Eaten,"Tastes like a jar of chemical processed gunk. Please do not eat this or convince yourself to try it. As a fitness junkie, I can eat just about anything and have made substitutions for just about every guilty indulgence out there...you are better off sticking to PB2!!"
A3TTFPB103VBW5,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Pretty awful,"I've tried a few of the salad dressings and they were pretty good all things considered, so I thought I'd give this a whirl because I missed peanut butter. From reading the reviews I sort of knew what to expect, but I wanted to find out for myself. The texture is more like a spread (which I knew), but the flavor is just awful. It's overly sweet and doesn't taste like anything close to peanuts. Lesson learned."
AFY9Z05CNKP5T,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Something you can't un-taste, if your a man or animal","You can't un-taste this goup. The reviewers who said this stuff has the consistency of frosting are right, but it doesn't taste like frosting. Here is a true story that pretty much sums up this product: My sister's dog loves to eat everything, ESPECIALLY peanut butter. I swear, her dog takes one sniff of this stuff and runs the other way. He won't touch it! And this dog LOVES peanut butter more than anything! That tells me all I need to know."
A2CHZ4CL75L9Z3,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Bleh!,"This product was so horrible that it's almost funny.  *ALMOST* being the key word, since I stupidly paid about $6 for this jar of creamy nastiness.  It basically tastes like creamed chemicals.  The only thing even slightly resembling peanut butter is the color.  Don't waste your money!"
A299YB5DVGR7R7,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Zero calorie with horrible taste,I bought this and gave it my all. I even mixed it with real peanut butter. It was horrible and just pitched it. Please do not buy. If it sounds too good to be true then it is. This was just horrible
A3L2H6LORJM25U,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Incredibly awful,"I am the queen of alternate, reduced-calorie foods, with an affinity for diet sodas, Splenda sweetener and everything substitutional.  This being the case, I have developed a taste for the artificial.  But even I cannot bear the flavor (and attributing the word flavor is being kind) of this product.  There isn't even a hint of peanut taste.  I took one spoonful and had to spit it right back out.  Even went so far as to try to re-flavor the product with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar-free maple syrup.  Nothing... absolutely nothing... will make this product edible.  Do not waste your money.  Try PB2 powdered peanut butter instead.  45 calories for 2 tablespoons, but tastes even better than full-fat peanut butter."
A3JDG7N4DVNBWX,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would.","I saw this on the shelf at my local grocery store and thought, ""What a brilliant idea!"" I love peanut butter, and the thought of consuming more than a few spoonfuls of the stuff was enough to make me purchase it. Upon opening the jar, I was met by a wobbling mass of glutinous, jelly-like stuff. I dipped a spoon in, stirred it up, and introduced a generous dollop into my mouth. My reaction: BLECHHHHH! The ""peanut spread"" did not make it down my throat, but the aftertaste stuck with me for hours. I use Splenda frequently in my tea and cereal, but oh lord, this stuff is DISGUSTING. It went straight into the trash can. What a waste of $4."
A11YOTONCPRQ9S,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Weird,This is the strangest stuff.  It looks like peanut butter until you put a spoon in it.  It's super-whipped and spreads oddly.  And the taste is just not right.  I don't know that I'd buy this again.
A2EY1PVY9DYC8V,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,JUST PLAIN NASTY,"I love Walden Farms.  I order their salad dressings and syrups in quantity and gladly pay the shipping for the priviledge.  The other day I was in HEB and experienced great joy to see that they carried almost all of the dressings and several fruit spreads.  Then, I saw the peanut butter.  I knew they made one and looked forward to trying it someday.<br /><br />Based on the quality of their other products (which I have been using for over a year now), I bought 2 jars.  Well,  I just opened the first one... revulsion on all levels.  The color- while a color in nature, not the color of something I want to eat.  The smell- sweet in a chemical way.  The texture- what texture?  I tasted it. YUCK.  Tried again... more YUCK.<br /><br />The product does not remotely smack of peanuts or any other nut for that matter.  This from a person who is NOT picky.<br /><br />Happily, the jars are glass and therefore reusable for other more worthy items.  I am going to try P2B instead if I find myself craving peanut butter to the necessary degree.  I am think I am off PB now!<br /><br />BTW- I am being KIND in this review..."
AES9OCHHHX1NP,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,worst immatation of peanut butter ever!!,Dont waste your money on this!!It taste nothing like peanut butter and the texture is weird to say the least.Total waste of money!!If you are looking for a lower calorie or carb peanut butter get better n butter.It is the best!!Taste's just like peanut butter....
ABQ2WFC0DYOIE,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,DISGUSTING!!!,"This stuff is gross.  I have never tasted a product substitute that is soo far from the real thing.  The texture was gross, the flavor was gross, the smell is gross.  We passed it around work to see the reactions of all our co-workers when they tasted it.  Nobody liked it, it was so funny seeing the reactions when they tasted it.  It is great for a good laugh.  seriously this stuff is bad."
A25SOAOV6KQ4CU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Totally Vile,This fake peanut butter was so totally disgusting that I could not even eat more than a smear on a spoon.  This says a lot because I don't find many foods completely repusive.  It makes me shudder just thinking about it.
A3CZ3QYYMBPWZD,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Gross!!,I even tried this when I was starving..and I still spit it out!!  not good at all..I should I went with every ones elses reviews. Dont waste your money!!
A1MXCHMV9PBIZR,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Great alternative for those who truely need it,"First of all, I did read some of the reviews.  I have to say most of you are buying this product for the wrong reasons.  No one should be on a 500 calorie diet.  1200 is the min.  This is not a product to ""lose weight"".  There are other products you can use of real peanut butter for that.  This product is designed for those of us who have restrictions due to diabeties or gluten related issues.  I have to watch my carbs and sugars very carefully and saw this as a great alternative on a diabetic store sight.  I tried it with the grape spread.  The two together are not bad.  On bread, it is alot like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.  But without the carbs, sugars and fat associated with it.  The taste is not bad, it is actually alot like a whipped mousse.  The grape spread was good with it.  Will I buy it again?  Probably, unless I find something the same that is better.<br />Do not always follow the reviews, most people have too high of expectations when they buy foods like these.  If you truely needed it because of health issues, you would be saying thank you's to this product."
A3H045JVZVVEL1,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Peanut Frosting,"This isn't exactly natural peanut butter, but more of a dessert product.  It has the texture of frosting in a can and is really salty and sweet.  I especially enjoy it with ice cream and sugar-free Hershey's syrup and cool-whip.  Its a little pricey though."
AJE65JN3X7F3E,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Just Unbelievably Awful!!!,"ZERO STARS!!! I cant begin to say how awful this gunk is. When I opened the jar, the contents looked disgusting, smelled awful and the taste was worse......."
A388XVI7JZYV86,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,No peanut flavor,"I was very excited to try this item because it had no calories. Well, it sounds to good to be true...it doesnt taste anything like peanuts whatsoever! I really wanted to like this, but unfortunatley i wasted my money! Dont waste yours!"
A2D4ODIUEX9ZVY,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Awful,"I am not anti-walden farms: I enjoy very much their syrups, chocolate dip and several of the ""jams."" But peanut butter is something that ""needs"" a consistency that synthetic products just cannot provide. It tastes absolutely awful--putting more than a pea's worth in my mouth made me gag."
A1JK2JW8VUE44O,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Either you love it or hate it.....,"I do really enjoy many of the Walden Farm products, but this product taste really terrible in my opinion.  I am not a picky eater, but this product doesn't even taste like food.  The smell, texture, and taste are so way off, it's almost impossible to describe.  It's definitely a very artificial flavor, which wouldn't be so bad if it tasted in anyway like peanuts, but it doesn't even remotely taste like a nut of any kind. I tried mixing it with other things to mask the flavor, because most Walden Farm products don't taste great on their own, but are good mixed with the right foods. That didn't make it any more palatable, it just ruined whatever I mixed it with. Just know that you are taking a chance buying this product, you will either really like it or end up throw it in the trash like I did."
A3QBMETFZPKW4L,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Not so bad...,"Walden Farms peanut spread is not going to displace Peter Pan or Jif any time soon but for someone who is on an extremely limited low fat diet (due to medical condition) or who is minimizing fat intake for whatever reason, this can provide a helpful substitute for a traditional comfort food.  Works well with jam or jelly for a PBJ, dip (or spread on) a banana, top some fat-free, sugar free ice cream with this, spread between two crackers.<br /><br />I have been known to add a sprinkle of Grape-Nuts when making a sandwich - makes it ""crunchy"" style :-)<br /><br />Not for everyone but a great alternative in my book."
A32Q5HN7RQN6GL,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Minority Opinion - But I LOVE This Spread,"I discovered this great product about several months ago and since then have consumed a jar or two of it every month. I love it and order it by the case now. I use it almost daily, and sometimes more than once a day. It isn't peanut butter but it has a nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry, strawberry and apple seem to work best) it makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this ""Peanut Spread"" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons)."
A3DT5DI5ID9R1J,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,This is not like peanut butter at all,"I purchased the product hoping for a peanut butter sandwhich. I was so excited when it came I immediately cut up an apple spead the peanut spread on the fruit and OMG YUCK. It was bitter and had only a hint of a peanut butter taste. I was going to throw it out but decided to try a spoonful in my chocolate/peanutbutter protein shake. Come to find out it gave the drink a better taste. So I have decided to use it in recipies that would normally require peanut butter. Don't order if you are expecting it to taste anything like PB,.. A better suggestion would be PB2 has 45 calories per 2TBS."
A2BJCMZY51CQ6A,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Terrible taste!,"I had high hopes that I could tollerate this 0 calorie peanut butter spread, but it was not bearable! The taste was so awful I threw it in the trash the same day I recieved the package! Do NOT Bother trying!"
A2BYO5OYWTDSAK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Truly AWFUL!,"I bought this because I have been unable to get PB2 at my local store, so I thought I would give it a try. It is horrendous! I knew it wouldn't taste ""just like peanut butter"", but I was not prepared for how awful it was. Not only does it not taste like peanut butter, it doesn't taste like anything edible. I seriously can't imagine someone eating this and I eat a lot of ""healthy"" alternatives that other people think are not palatable, so I'm pretty forgiving. I'm just floored that this product could even make it to the shelves, seriously."
A3GA7VBD1PJJKU,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,The Buddha calls it dukkha,"As I am writing this, this listing has 130 (out of 173) 1-star reviews (soon to be 131). Please bear in mind that I rarely review products; I must feel very strongly about one before I review it.<br /><br />I am an adventurous person, and when it comes to food, as long is it is vegetarian I will try anything. Even if the experience is terrible I do not regret chancing it; this is how you find GOOD foods (also bad). But IMHO this product is not good and it is probably not food. Judging by the ingredients, it appears to be mainly water, vegetable fiber (probably the bulk of its volume), and peanut flavoring/extract. I lean toward health foods and like others, have portion control issues when it comes to legit pb, one of my famous weaknesses. I was intrigued when I found this in our local wal mart; calorie-free imitation peanut butter! With low expectations I opted to give it a fair chance BEFORE reading a single review.<br /><br />I mistakenly applied this product single-agent to a sandwich. I have not yet managed to consume this in its entirety; it was a failed experiment. I will hold off on throwing this out until I have mustered up the courage to attempt it in a different setting. It has a few positive reviews, so I suspect that it may be redeemable somehow (I may take up some reviewers' suggestions) but thus far I believe this product to be a travesty; this is coming from a person who can tolerate certain well-known brands of veggie bacon.<br /><br />Okay, I knew this product would be so different from actual pb that it would be unfair to compare it. I did not expect it to resemble pb, however I did expect it to resemble food at least in some remote fashion. The texture is that of a synthetic, waxy, fluffy butter (why is it ""whipped""???). The taste is.. somewhat akin to the same, but I would not recommend it as a butter substitute except in non-food usages which I may attempt, as I hate to be wasteful. I would compare the taste to what I would expect of a spread made from crayons. Brown crayons, ew.<br /><br />So here's my 100% honest and dead-serious evaluation: truly, you and I are better off looking to natural sources with awesome flavor and more balanced nutrition to go with the calories. We could probably do with a little less artifice all around, and this product has no nutritional value whatsoever-- except some sodium. It even lacks dietary fiber, despite vegetable fiber being the second ingredient listed (after water)! If you are trying to eat healthier, this is surely not the way. If you are on a low-calorie diet, learn portion control-- and I empathize with the pain you feel in even considering cutting down on our beloved peanut butter. As for myself, I have to get my protein from somewhere and pb is my main squeeze, so in my pantry the Walden Farms was never destined to be more than a novelty to begin with.<br /><br />The one good thing that came of this experience, besides satisfying my curiosity? A number of the 1-star reviews praised certain other Walden Farms products DESPITE this unforgettable failure. I consider this a brave endorsement as I would personally be embarrassed to defend the entities that brought this abomination into our world. So brave, in fact, that I am convinced of their authenticity (unless ALL of these individuals are trolling), and will be looking forward to sampling OTHER Walden Farms products (this was my first). But, as for redeeming this one, I am not hopeful.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />- I DO NOT recommend this product in any way.<br /><br />- I CANNOT recommend any alternative low-cal pb substitutes as I have not personally sampled any others.<br /><br />+ I DO recommend MaraNatha for a more natural and flavorful nut butter experience. With some self-control it is worth the calories and the price.<br /><br />+ I HIGHLY recommend, in addition to the above, diet and exercise. If you can't cut portions, walk it off."
A19V494D6W69AF,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Bleh!!!,"I wouldn't subject prisoners to eat this ""peanut butter"" as part of their sentence. Even my German Shepard who eats everything (including sheetrock) was nauseated by it. I rinsed out my mouth with raw sewage afterwards, which was an improvement."
A2IAGBEEHPS7HP,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Ack!,"The choice between no peanut butter and this ""spread"" was incredibly easy to make after just one taste.<br /><br />I was prepared for this to not taste just like peanut butter but I wasn't prepared for it to be one of the worst things I have ever tasted.<br /><br />It was only slightly more palatable than the grasshopper I accidentally chomped down on as a child."
A3T5SCEXFJL4K2,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Nastiest Thing EVER,"I tried this hoping for a good substitute for peanut butter, because I am truly addicted to it, which means no weight loss for me.  It was absolutely horrible.  I couldn't even get down one spoonful of the stuff, even when I tried spreading it on some bread.  Just awful!  Ewwwwwwwwww."
A2Q5L6MIT5TKCG,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,yuck,"Totally disgusting.  It went directly in the garbage, And I'm not a fussy eater.  This has to be Walden farms worst product."
AZ2V33TVW3N96,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Rotten Peanut Butter,"I love peanut butter and at 200 calories a serving it just doesn't fit into a healthy diet, especially when you're trying to lose weight. I'm a nurse and I work with patients who have kidney failure and they have to limit their peanut intake due to the high potassium, so I thought this would be a good peanut butter substitute for me and the patients. I did not buy this through Amazon, I came across it by accident at Wal-Mart. It was only $3. I was so excited. Couldn't wait to get home to try it. It was the first thing I opened when I got home. It smelled like peanut butter, looked like peanut butter, tasted like rotten peanut butter. What did I expect for 0 calories, 0 fat, and $3. I got my mom to taste it and she just gagged. I gave it 1 star because you have to rate it."
A3AP73GXS4896Z,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,no thank you,"I ordered this product hoping that I had finally found a healthy substitute to peanut butter.  Boy, was I wrong.  This was the most vile thing I have ever tasted.  The smell alone was enough to make my stomach churn, and when I actually took a bite, I started gagging.  It was horrible.  I would never order this again.<br /><br />However, I have heard that the other Walden Farms products are not this bad!  I haven't tried any yet, but I do plan on trying some out eventually :)"
AL73DM6NR9D7G,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Yuk,"I threw it out.  I thought it went bad, it was so bad.  It did not represent peanut butter at all.  Most of Walden Farms products are good, but this PB stuff was a real disappointment."
A3THZMHYLVEL8J,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Gag!,"I'm a sucker for low cal, low fat things- I'm always looking for ways to satisfy my cravings without ""cheating"". This is not it- I'm not sure how anyone with taste buds could even slightly stomach this junk. I am very disappointed and after taking one half a teaspoon out of the jar, it ended up in the trash can. Yuck- dont waste your $$$$"
A1KVCPBLLN3LSV,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,One taste and you'll throw it away,I am a big fan of Walden Farms dressings.  I had big hopes for this peanut spread.  I tasted it and immediately threw it away.  It was a flavor that does not grow on you; yiak!!  I am pretty dissapointed; I wish I wold have saved the receipt so I could return it.  Save your receipt until you taste it.
A13N9MZJPY2KOV,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,tastes like liquid plastic,2 bites and it went in the garbage... and i only took the second bite to make sure i actually tasted what i tasted... and stirred it and it was still tasted like someone took a dump in my mouth...  i never review products... but this one i had to.
A14CIOVZ1NBXXK,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Nasty,This is the first time I have tried any Walden Farms products. If the rest are as bad as this Peanut spread I am not interested in anything they make. It tasted awful and left an after taste that would not go away. I had to brush my teeth to get rid of it. Went straight into the garbage.
AEGC7JOCGGF4R,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Better than my (low) expectations.,"Everyone's taste is subjective but here is my 2 cents worth. I'd read all the reviews so my expectations were minimal. I can honestly say I was mildly surprised as there was a slight peanut smell to the product. I used it on a toasted English muffin & it wasn't that bad (although it didn't melt at all). For my money, it tastes similar, & certainly no worse than Better 'n Peanut Butter. It wins out over BnPB which has 100 calories per 2 T serving. But PB2 easily tastes more authentic than either of them, but PB2 does have 45 calories per 2T serving. And PB2's other drawback is that it's a hassle to mix. But if I'm not dieting, it's REAL peanut butter for me."
A1EJKV8JY54E2L,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Save your money - this stuff is gross,"I bought this on a whim while I was grocery shopping.  No calories, no fats and no carbs seemed too good to be true.  The ingredient list was a little scary but I thought it might be worth a shot.  Big mistake.  This stuff is nasty tasting.  To me it tasted like sickly sweet chemicals.  The healthier I eat, the more I can taste the chemicals in processed foods such as this.  If it had actually tasted anything like peanuts it might have been ok but that sickly sweet taste is just gross.  I'd rather just give up eating peanut butter altogether than try to replace it with this spread."
A3HP2YDRNBF0EO,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"Bad, bad, bad!!!","I saw this product and thought it would be awesome!  Peanut butter without the calories, what is not to love!?  But...then I actually tried a tiny taste.  Thank God I tried a TINY bit and was close to the sink because I spit it right out.  Can't recall many times I've ever had to seriously spit out a nasty food, but this was disgusting.  It was like a massive amount of salt and artificial sweetner.  Will NEVER buy this again or probably any other product of theirs.  Yikes..."
A22DZFQCWYDGQJ,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Wow!,Nothing could ave prepared me for this. The taste was horrifying! Worse thing i've ever tasted in my life. I was in shock that they'd sell it. I thought for a while maybe I had bought a bad jar. Proves I did NOT. It really baffles me... Would NEVER buy this again.
A1MNHXEMAJNOBD,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Does not live up to the Walden Farms name,"I use many of the Walden products and they are all quite good.  The salad dressings are especially tasty.  I know what I am buying and keep my expectations at the appropriate levels; however, this product does not live up to any expectation at all.  It is terrible and tastes like chemicals.  I am a forgiving dieter when it comes to what I am willing to eat just to get ""the feeling"" and this just doesn't do it and in fact leaves an awful aftertaste.  Better off just taking peanut butter or any thought of it out of your diet repetoire."
A3IP76TGSGY4DA,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Awful,Do not waste your money. This product is gross and over priced---and probably full of chemicals and such. That's all.
A25ISENSACV7SX,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,"looks really bad ,tastes even worse!!",this tastes really really horrible and plus it looks disgusting too.Save yourself some money and do not buy this product.you will thank yourself for not getting this
A156LB7D9SSF6J,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Don't waste your money...,"I recently received a half price offer for Walden Farms, buy up to 10 of their products and get up to five free.  The Peanut Spread is one of the items I tried.  While I was not expecting anything like real peanut butter, I was hoping it would be something palatable that I could use for a sandwich or to spread on celery.  IT WAS TERRIBLE tasting nothing like peanut butter and barely tasting of anything peanut related.  The aftertaste was terrible! I tried a bit on a teaspoon and it repeated on me for hours."
AWLVXTQ4SO4C8,B000X1Q1G8,Peanut Butter,Disgusting!,"I am usually pretty open and when it comes to lower caloried foods, i am willing to sacrafice taste to get that craving out of the way. But this stuff is repulsive.  I tried to even after i refridgerated it....and it didnt help..there was some sort of watery stuff in it.  I am thinking if you mix some reduced fat peanut butter in it, it may help.  I have not tried that yet..but this is really gross....I think i am going to try PB2 and see how that is.  I guess i am being too harsh considering it is zero calories..but i cant really even tollerate the taste.  :-("
A7AQRO4NVPO1C,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Awful...,"Under normal circumstances, I can begrudgingly stomach ""diet"" drinks, but this is probably the worst drink that I've ever had in my life.  It tastes like what I imagine cleaning products to taste like.  The ""sweetener,"" which they added way too much of, actually leaves a noticeably bitter aftertaste.  I would much rather drink just lemon water with no sugar added, as a healthy and palatable alternative.  Horrible, just horrible..."
A17E8M6CONCHAV,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Imagine if you will...,"...that the year is 1700. You've just come in from a hard days work in the field and you want to quench your thirst with some delectable lemonade. But alas, you are a poor farmer, and cannot afford lemons from the lemon tree. Instead, you collect the urine from the goats that inhabit your farm, pour it into a cup fashioned from cow dung, and drink it.<br /><br />This product is essentially the same thing."
A1IWAQ8CRAEOUN,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,God Awful,"I just got this drink at the retail store I work at. This drink doesn't even deserve 1 star. I can honestly say this is the worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. It was so bad, I kept it to let my friends taste and share my worst drink experience ever. After tasting this, I immediately went online to see all of the hilariously bad reviews. It's labeled a Thirst Quencher. It's more like a gateway drink because it makes you want to immediately drink something else to get the taste out of your mouth. The #1 ingredient should say vomit because that is what you are highly inclined to do. This is worse than cancer."
A2290LI0KHFT2T,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Disgusting,I love the Honest Teas and the lightly sweetened 1/2 Tea 1/2 lemonade so I picked up some zero calorie Honest Ade Classic Lemonade.  It tastes like lemon-scented soap smells.  It is so over-sweet I gagged on my first sip.  Do not make the same mistake I did.  Just go with the regular lower calorie versions of this brand's offerings.  Skip the stevia-sweetened disgusting zero calorie versions.  I can't get the taste out of my mouth an hour later.  So nasty.
A281NPSIMI1C2R,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Try a bottle locally first...,"After seeing this lemonade recommended in a health magazine I decided to see if it was as good as they said it was. After reading other's opinion I decided if it was that bad I'd have to try it for myself.<br /><br />I'm a fan of stevia. I drink stevia sweetened beverages all day long so I know what it is supposed to taste like. To me it is almost as good as sugar. The stevia used in this drink seems fine and didn't have an awful bitter taste. You can get various types of stevia and this one seems perfectly sweet.<br /><br />I think the problem with this ""lemonade"" is that it also has lime juice in it. That is what I'm tasting and it seems a little strong. In fact the aroma of lime seems to be what first hits your nose as you are about to take a drink. That seems to be a little confusing since you think you are drinking lemonade not limeade.<br /><br />The aroma aside, the lemon flavor is actually not bad but is very mild. Think more of a lemon water than a lemonade. If you drink this while holding your nose closed it tastes much better. If I was Honest Ade I'd take out the lime juice. I'd also like to know what ""natural flavor"" is. Is that a lemon or lime zest flavor? Maybe they could take that out too.<br /><br />A lemonade should taste pure like a summer day. I feel that in making this they are trying too hard to be different. Please Honest Ade - make this just with lemon juice. I make my own lemonade all the time with just straight lemon juice and a packet of stevia and it tastes better than this. I'm giving this a three because it is not as bad as I expected. I just don't like the aroma and the acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
A18HG89C3X1TYF,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,honest ade,I hate this so much i would rather drink a gallon of elk urine than this horrid stuff. If i were stuck in the desert with no water and only Honest Ade I would rather die than ever consume it again. Honest Ade should be called Honestly AIDS because that is what i feel like i have tasted after drinking it.
A20BRFAR2QH06C,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,I'd rather drink water,"Don't waste your money on lemonade that tastes like waste water. That's a bit of an exaggeration. But this does not taste like lemonade, it doesn't taste like anything you'd want to drink."
A2JH0XEQOHCVF4,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,I do like it,I like its taste and sweetness. My body doesn't tolerate artificial sweeteners and I can't drink any light sodas. I'm not a big fun of stevia - I have tried a few stevia products to replace the sugar in baking and they all have this awful aftertaste. But Honest Ade has no aftertaste. I buy it at Stop& Shop for $1 /bottle -sale price.But I wouldn't pay regular price :$1.50 - it's to much.
A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Plastic bottle flavoring + too much stevia = An honestly awful drink,"This is not a good beverage.  For a diet lemonade, it has a rather extensive list of ingredients that do not produce a flavor you want to remember.  This beverage is sweetened with stevia.  I don't mind stevia but there is such a thing as too much.  This beverage has entirely too much of it.  All I could taste when I drank this was the stevia, lemon, and plastic bottle.  I'm serious about the last one.  On the side of the bottle, the manufacturer boasts that PETE plastic is non-leaching.  This beverage, however, has a distinctly plastic taste.  Again, this is not a case of my needing to get used to the stevia.  Like I said, I don't mind stevia in moderation.  This company needs to go back to the drawing board.  If you are seeking a diet beverage that is not sweetened with aspartame and actually tastes fairly good, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I573FS"">Acai Lemonade Sugar Free Drink Sticks 1.7 oz sticks 12 Sticks</a>, which can be purchased at health food stores, iherb.com and Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Purified water, organic lemon juice concentrate, organic lemon extract, organic lime juice concentrate, citric acid, organic stevia extract, organic natural flavor, ascorbic acid, mixed carotene.<br /><br />This product contains 3% juice.<br />This product is gluten-free."
A39ZY0WOOG6ARN,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Like cilantro -- you either love it or hate it?,I recently found this at a local market and was hoping to find it less expensive at amazon (my local market is cheaper). From the other reviews I can only assume that there is something in this drink that either pleases the palate -- or doesn't -- with very little in between preferences. I'm in the camp that thinks this drink is wonderful -- refreshing and not overly sweet.
AACVV2DFE053T,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,This is a terrible drink,"This ""lemonade"" is worse than the champagne drink called a French 75 I had at Pat O's in the French Quarter that tasted like meat marinade and although I had spent 7 bucks, I poured it out. It tastes worse than that Icee I drank in grade school that unbeknownst to me had a cockroach in the bottom of it. The experience was worse than the time when I was a kid and my dad went to the store to go get apple cider, but he was drunk so he accidentally got apple cider vinegar and I took a big swig and threw up.<br /><br />I don't know if its the stevia sweetener, which I had never had before, or they got a terrible batch of lemons, or what the problem might have been, but this is by far the worst bottled ""refreshment"" that I have ever had. Never again."
A37E20UKEMDZJ1,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Try it more than once.,"OK, here's the thing about this lemonade:  we are so used to consuming overly sweet, high calorie food & beverages that when you take your first sip of this lemonade, you might not like it.  My first reaction, admittedly, was, ""Ew!"" due to the tart taste and the absence of sweetness.  It was definitely not your Country Time brand.  Then I took another sip, and another, and now I find that I'm hooked on this stuff.  It's very light-tasting, not sweet, and it's a bit tart.  I love it.  To give you another example, it's like being a regular Coke drinker and then drinking Diet Coke for the first time.  At first, the taste seems off.  But after awhile, the regular version seems sickeningly sweet.  If you like regular versions of soda and lemonade, then you might not like Honest Ade at first; but keep in mind why you like the reg. version (overly sweet taste)-you might just want to change your habits."
A2348V2I9KTVJO,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Never again.,"I try not to right a negative review, but drinking this has got to be the worst experience I ever had with any drink. I took one sip of it and it had me gagging. I had to get a bottle of minute maid lemonade just to wash the taste away, and even after that, my mouth was still completely dry and still had the horrid aftertaste. I would not give this to my worst enemy."
A2ZORE46UVMJEI,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,So disgusting,"I bought a bottle at the company cafeteria and couldn't take more than two sips.  I like stevia.  I like other Honest Ade drinks.  That said, I have no idea how this junk made it to market.  I've literally never tasted a beverage so bad; I thought I had gotten a bottle that had been improperly stored.  I went online to see what other people thought and I'm not alone, this is just a plain awful tasting drink.  No lemon taste and some horrible strange aftertaste that doesn't taste like any stevia I've ever tried.  The full bottle is sitting on my desk, but I won't force myself to try any more of it to give better details of just how bad this stuff is.  Avoid like the plague."
AKR60YFXQZ50G,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Worst tasting drink ever!,"Alright, I made the mistake of buying a few of these without realizing they were ""zero calorie"".<br /><br />Let me tell you that the sweetener used (setiva?) makes this drink taste AWFUL! Upon first gulp, there is little flavor. Then a terrible wave of the taste of battery acid overwhelms your mouth. Then a ""fake"" sweet aftertaste looms making you want to wash it away with more. Bad idea.<br /><br />This certainly doesn't taste like lemonade and I wouldn't drink it if someone gave it to me for free at this point. Please don't buy ANY Honest Zero beverages, stick with the regular variety which are pretty good."
A1BUES4LG08Z51,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Worst tasting drink ever,"Honest Ade's zero calorie lemonade is the worst tasting thing I've ever had.  It tastes like someone squirted a little lemon juice in some gasoline, and bottled it.  It's not sour... it's not sweet... it's just disgusting.  I tried to continue drinking it, but I was afraid my face would permanently be stuck in the awful cringe I continued making."
A13AF1N1MBS0U6,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Ugh,"I don't write reviews often, but when something is this bad I am inspired to share my experience.<br /><br />There is a hint of lemon in there, somewhere, but it mostly tastes like un-sweet, burnt honey (not that I've ever had such a thing, but I imagine it would taste something like this drink).  I guess, maybe, bad Mezcal tastes worse (which I usually describe as tasting like cheap Tequila that has been left sitting for about a year in a rusty barrel stuffed with the remnants of old, dirty tires).<br /><br />By the way, one star is the lowest rating, apparently (otherwise I would have given it 0)."
A1440CKLS40TE3,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,DISGUSTING,Read my title and if that doesn't get the point across... then think of the worst thing you've tasted in your life. Multiply that by four.
A1CJSBG3FFAQSB,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Try one before you buy a case.,"Try one before you buy a case.  Because if you regret spending $1.79 for a bottle like I did, you're really going to hate dumping $25 for a case of this crap.  It is hands-down, beyond a doubt, the worst commercially available drink I've had in at least 10 years.  Maybe it's the Stevia sweetener, I don't know, but I barely choked down a quarter of the bottle before pouring the rest down the drain.  The aftertaste is abominable.  It doesn't remotely qualify as a drink, much less lemonade.  I'm trying to give it zero stars, but the website is forcing me to give at least one."
A1VC3S6DR14K6Z,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,"Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting.","As one reviewer here said, this is THE worst drink I have EVER had in my life, and I'm OLD!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The aftertaste? Unlike any I have ever had in my life, and I thought diet sodas could not be topped in disgustingness.<br /><br />Well, Honest Ade (spent all your money on marketing and none on taste testing?), you did it.<br /><br />You have the honor, albeit a dubious one, of having the single most disgusting drink on the entire planet.<br /><br />I kid you not."
A1GU7J5K7BN5OF,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Really Honest Ade?,"Let me say a couple things first. 1. 99% of the drinks I have (not including water) are diet/low calorie ones. 2. I love Honest Ade. Now that I got that off my chest. What the hell Honest Ade?! This is one of the grossest things I have ever tasted. It tastes like sugar water. My boyfriend just thought I was being picky, so he tried it himself and could barley swallow it. Try the cranberry lemonade. It's tangy, slightly sweet and all around delicious."
A1KC11VXN5GR3E,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,"3% Juice + Stevia , Lemonade","The first problem: There's only 3% juice! Unless you're dumping artificial flavors in there, 3% lemon juice isn't lemonade, it's lemon water. But I'd rather have lemon water than deal with...<br /><br />The second problem: Stevia has no place in lemonade. Maybe in tea, where its molasses-like earthy flavor would blend well, it might work. But the stevia clashes horribly with what little lemon flavor comes through, resulting in a thoroughly unsatisfying beverage."
AG2ZT124N2LYO,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,If at First----,"The first one I tried I thought the product was ""taste free"". The second one I thought ""this isn't too bad""! Now, I can't leave it alone. Only concern is if I can buy it at a decent price. Love it."
A33TV6I6V13N05,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Don't!,I'm so glad that I only bought one bottle!  What was this company thinking?  Didn't anyone taste this stuff before bottling it?  Oh my gosh...I took a big gulp (expecting something delicious and refreshing) and just about spit it out!  This form of stevia is so bitter :-(  Don't waste your money!
AFI6D0Y3FA3GT,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Disgusting,"This lemonade is absolutely disgusting, I thought something was wrong with it but after reading these other review, obviously not. I took two sips and threw it away."
A138M40S9LGZ7I,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Horrible,"I wonder how awful the test batch versions of this drink were before they decided to go with this finished product.  Easily the worst drink I have ever purchased.  And I like Honest Tea! I encouraged my gf to buy this, not knowing it would be vomit inducing.  Honest Tea RECALL THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE YOU LOSE CUSTOMERS! This vile concoction was my first taste of stevia as well - I don't think I will be trying that again either."
A1PFUDAOBJD9Z3,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,The worst drink ever?,Wow... I can't believe I paid for something that tastes this bad.  I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.  Just amazingly bad.  I mean A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y BAD!!!!  How anyone could decide it was a good idea to sell this is beyond me...
A2A3MJGCDBXP9B,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Terrible,"I just picked up a bottle of this lemonade at my local grocery store. I enjoy other Honest Ade drinks, and hoped that their attempt at a stevia-sweetened beverage would be equally as good. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. It tasted awful, with some kind of plastic or chemical flavor that I can't even begin to describe. My husband just about lost his lunch when he tasted it. We thought maybe it was just a bad bottle, but after reading all of the horrible reviews, I'm thinking they need to hire some new taste testers. If you want a good lemonade that is sweetened with stevia, try the Trop50 line of juices instead."
A12WG43SZ7F2LF,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,"Worst. ""Lemonade"". Ever!","I can honestly say this is the worst lemonade I have ever had. The after taste is just as terrible as the taste that first hits your taste buds. I gave this drink a shot and it is a bust! It almost tastes like it was made with bad lemons or something but it may be the Stevia that is used. Regardless, it is God awful."
A306JMZXOHTWRJ,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Vile,"This tastes nothing like lemonade.  It is awful.  It is inedible.  It doesn't even deserve one star.  I poured it down the drain.  The reviewers who said we're just not used to it are correct.  I'm not used to drinking sewer sludge, either, but that doesn't mean I need to become accustomed to it.  I drink nothing but diet drinks and I can think of a half dozen, some organic, that taste a million times better than this foul swill."
A3T0OTH5072YRE,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Honest Ade Classic Lemonade,"This was pretty bad.  Not completely terrible, I managed to chug the whole thing down, but still not very good.  I would not get this drink again, although I may try some of the other drinks from the brand since they are supposed to be pretty good.  Maybe something with a stronger taste than light lemon would be better.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this drink would be the taste.  I honestly think it tasted like lemon sawdust.  And I'm not sure why it tasted that way.  I don't think it was the stevia, as I've drank things with stevia in it before without this effect, so I'm not sure what to blame.  It had just a little bit of sweetness to go along with the sawdust but there wasn't a very strong taste of anything.  The lemon taste was very faint, and as said before, it was mostly covered by the sawdust taste.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product are good, which kept it from getting one star.  Most everything is organic, and stevia is the sweetener.  A pretty healthy drink in all.  It also had zero calories and zero fat, so its a good diet drink if it was more palatable.  And at 16.9 fl oz, it lasts for a couple of hours (at least for me anyway) when drinking.  The Honest brand also boasts that its gluten free, no GMO's, is recycled, and they plant a tree, so lots of good things going on with the company in general.<br /><br />Not too great, I don't recommend it to anyone.  Try another of the brand if you want to try any.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
A1UUPKHLG9MR9L,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Awful.,"This stuff is terrible.  There must be a huge amount of stevia in it because the drink tastes like stevia and plastic.  It's sickeningly sweet, with a bad aftertaste.  Some reviewers state that people don't like it because it doesn't taste sweet enough, so I can only conclude we have a different reaction to the stevia in this lemonade.  It was bad enough, after just a few sips I came online to leave a review."
A1N65D9MJX89GI,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,AMAZING AND ADDICTING!,"This is the best and most delicious 0-cal drink out there!!! I think that the people who don't like it just have no tastebuds. I cannot understand why anyone would find it anything other than heavenly. I only wish they were $1, or the ten-for-ten deal. They are more expensive than 0-cal vitamin water, but they are also yummier, and healthier."
AELQNIEEB4Y40,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Beware..your results may vary,"This product is very hit or miss for people. It DOES NOT really taste anything like the heavily sugared ""tradtional"" lemonades out there, and the stevia can leave a aftertaste for most people that they find unappealing.  That being said I enjoy it myself very much, but i use it primarly to make a half and half lemonade/ice tea with unsweetened ice tea. Makes a very refreshing drink on hot summer days that way with no sugar added."
A2I6DISKM0YKM8,B004Z33GI6,Lemonade,Soooo good!,"With summer upon us (it was almost 100 degrees here yesterday!), it's time to start thinking about quenching thirst the right way. So many people reach for sugary and calorie-ridden drinks which only provide short-term refreshment and way too many calories. Thank goodness for Honest Tea! Their Classic Lemonade has the delicious taste of fresh-squeezed lemons with just the right amount of sweetness--all of that with no calories or sugar! It's the perfect summertime drink."
